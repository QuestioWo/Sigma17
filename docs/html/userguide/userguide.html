<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Sigma16 is a computer architecture designed for research and teaching in computer systems. This application provides a complete environment for experimenting with the architecture, including an editor, assembler, linker, emulator, and an integrated development environment. There is a digital circuit that implements the architecture, which is specified using the Hydra functional hardware description language. Hydra can simulate the circuit, and machine language programs can run on both the emulator and the circuit.</p>
<p>The Sigma16 IDE (the main “app”) is implemented in JavaScript and runs in a web browser. There are additional components to the system that must be downloaded and run on a computer; these include a digital circuit that implements the architecture and a high speed emulator. You can run the IDE simply by clicking a link on the <a href="https://jtod.github.io/home/Sigma16/">Sigma16 Home Page</a>.</p>
<p>This user guide is organised by topic, with chapters on the architecture, the assembly language, the linker, and programming techniques. However, it’s a good idea to begin with an overview of how the whole system works, and to be able to write and run simple programs, before delving into the details. For a quick start, begin with the tutorials, which show you how to enter and run a program and how to use the programming environment.</p>
<h1 id="tutorials">Tutorials</h1>
<p>The following short tutorials introduce the system; full details appear in later sections. You can keep the tutorials visible in the right panel while following along with the exercises in the main panel.</p>
<h2 id="hello-world">Hello, world!</h2>
<p>To launch the program, visit the Sigma16 Home Page and click on the link to run it.</p>
<p>The main window contains two main sections. The largest area, on the left side, is the <em>main working area</em>. When the program launches, this will show the Welcome page. The <em>user guide</em> is on the right side. At the top is a row of buttons (Welcome, Examples, etc.). These select which page is displayed in the main working area.</p>
<p>It’s convenient to see the main working area and the user guide side by side. Begin by resizing the entire window (bigger is better). Then you can change the amount of space given to the user guide by clicking the arrow symbols on the right side of the top button bar. These arrows will expand or shrink the user guide: the small arrows adjust by one pixel, the larger arrows by ten pixels. If you resize the entire browser window, Sigma16 will maintain the same relative sizes of the main working area and the user guide sections.</p>
<p>You can also open the User Guide in a separate browser tab or window. The Welcome page contains a link to do this.</p>
<p>A good way to get started is to go through the entire process of running a simple program called <em>Hellow, world!</em>. For now, we focus just on how to use the software tools to run the program; an explanation of the Sigma16 architecture and what the statements mean will come later.</p>
<p>The main working area has several pages, with buttons at the top to switch between them:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Welcome</strong> contains some introductory information, release notes, and links.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Examples</strong> contains a collection of assembly language programs organized by topic. The simplest examples just use the <em>Core</em> part of the architecture, while the <em>Advanced</em> examples use additional features.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Modules</strong> shows a summary of all the files and modules you currently have open. It also provides buttons allowing you to open files, close them, and select one to work on.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Editor</strong> shows the selected module, where it can be edited. You can assemble and execute the selected module. To run a program, you’ll load it into the Editor (there are several ways to do this), then assemble it and then run it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Assembler</strong> translates a program from assembly language to machine language, and shows the assembly isting as well as the object code.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Linker</strong> combines a collection of object code modles into a single executable program.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Processor</strong> shows the components of the architecture and executes machine language programs.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s begin by running a simple example program.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Click <strong>Editor</strong>, then <strong>Hello, world!</strong>. This will enter a small assembly language program into the editor window. Later, we’ll load some of the more complex example programs into the editor, and you can also modify a program or type in a new one from scratch.</p></li>
<li><p>Click <strong>Assembler</strong> and then the <strong>Assemble</strong> button. This translates the program in the Editor page from assembly language to machine language. The <strong>Assembly Listing</strong> button displays the result of the translation, including any error messages. The <strong>Object Code</strong> button displays the output from the translation.</p></li>
<li><p>For this simple example, we don’t need the Linker, so you can skip it. The linker is needed for larger and more complex programs with multiple modules, or with external references, or that need relocation.</p></li>
<li><p>Click <strong>Processor</strong>, which shows the main components of the computer architecture, including registers and memory. These components are explained later. For now, just note that this page is where you can run programs using the emulator.</p></li>
<li><p>Still on the Processor page, click <strong>Boot</strong>. This reads the machine language program into the memory, and you can see it in the Memory display. The source code (the assembly language) appears in the bottom section.</p></li>
<li><p>Click <strong>Step</strong>. The processor executes a single instruction and displays the effects on the registers and memory: blue for using a value, and red for modifying it. The assembly listing shows the instruction that just executed by highlighting it in red. It also shows the instruction that will execute next by highlighting it in blue. This is just to make it easier to follow what is happening; the actual machine ignores the assembly language listing and doesn’t even “know” that it exists.</p></li>
<li><p>Click Step repeatedly to watch the program execute, instruction by instruction. When the program terminates, the small window labelled <strong>Emulator</strong> will display Halted.</p></li>
<li><p>To rerun the program, click Boot again.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To run the program slowly, click Step repeatedly. To run the program faster but without updating the display after each instruction, click Run. At any time you can click Pause to stop the processor, and you can resume execution with either Step or Run.</p>
<p>There are two independent views into the memory; this is convenient for looking at the machine language code in one view and the data in the other view. (Despite the two views, there is just one memory!) At this point the pc register contains 0, meaning that the next instruction to be executed is the one in memory location 0. The ir and other registers also contain 0, but that is just the initial value.</p>
<p>To set a breakpoint, click Breakpoint and enter the stopping condition in the dialogue box. For example, to stop when the pc register becomes $01b7, enter BPeq BPpc (BPhex “01b7”). Then click Run, and the emulator will run at full speed until the pc reaches the specified value; then it will stop so you can examine the state of the machine.</p>
<p>To exit the app, just close the browser window or tab. This may put up a dialogue box warning that any unsaved data may be lost and asking you to confirm.</p>
<h2 id="registers-constants-and-arithmetic">Registers, constants, and arithmetic</h2>
<p>The architecture has a <strong>register file</strong> which is an array of 16 registers, named R0, R1, R2, …, R15. The Register File is displayed in a box on the Processor page.</p>
<p>A register is a circuit that can hold a number, and the elements of the register file can be used to hold variable values. They are analogous to the registers in a calculator: think of each register as a box that can hold a number, and think of the register name as a variable name.</p>
<p>A computer program is a sequence of <strong>instructions</strong>. Instructions are similar to statements in a programming language, except that they are simpler.</p>
<p>Sigma16 performs arithmetic on data in registers. To do any computation on some numbers, we first need to get those numbers into registers. To place a constant into a register, use the lea instruction. In the assembly language we use the <strong>lea</strong> instruction. For example, to load 42 into register 3, write</p>
<pre><code>    lea   R2,42[R0]   ; R2 := 42</code></pre>
<p>This is a statement in <strong>assembly language</strong>, and it describes one instruction. The operation is <strong>lea</strong>, the operands are <strong>R2,9[R0]</strong>, and the part after the semicolon is a comment.</p>
<p>The word <em>lea</em> is the <em>operation</em>, i.e. the name of the instruction. The operandd field consists of two operands separated by a comma. The first operand (R2) is called the <em>destination</em>; this is the register where the result will be placed. The second operand is a constant (42) followed by [R0]. When the computer executed this instruction, it simply places the constant into the destination. In a higher level language, we could write <em>R2 := 42</em>.</p>
<p>Most instructions follow a similar pattern, where the first operand is the destination where the result is placed, and the subsequent operands are the arguments to the computation. This is the same convention used in assignment statements in many programming languages: the registers in sub R1,R2,R3 appear in the same order as the variables in R1 := R2-R3.</p>
<p>For now, just ignore the <strong>[R0]</strong> part. This has a purpose but that won’t become clear until later. Also, the name “lea” may look odd, but this also has a meaning that will become clear later.</p>
<p>All arithmetic operations take place in the registers, and there is a separate instruction for each operation. For example, the following instruction will add the values in R8 and R1 and then put the result into R4:</p>
<pre><code>   add   R4,R8,R1  ; R4 := R8 + R1</code></pre>
<p>Notice that the operand field doesn’t use operators like := or +; instead it just separates the registers with commas. The first operand (R4 in this example) is the <em>destination</em>, which is where the result will be placed. The last two operands (R8 and R1) are the values that will be added.</p>
<p>To perform a calculation, need to get the data into registers (using lea) and then perform the calculation (using arithmetic instructions). The following program calculates 3+4:</p>
<pre><code>    lea   R5,3[R0]    ; R5 := 3
    lea   R8,4[R0]    ; R8 := 4
    add   R2,R5,R8    ; R2 := R5 + R8 = 3+4 = 7</code></pre>
<p>It’s a good idea to use comments to explain the meaning of an instruction. For now, comments like “R4 := R8 + R1” will be used to show what the instruction does. That’s useful while learning what the instructions do, but later on we will use comments to give more meaningful information (for example, what do the values in the registers mean, and why are we adding them?).</p>
<p>There are three more arithmetic instructions. These follow the same pattern as add: in each case, the arithmetic is performed on the last two registers and the result is placed in the destination (the first register):</p>
<pre><code>  add  R4,R11,R0   ; R4 := R11 + R0
  sub  R5,R2,R13   ; R5 := R2 - R13
  mul  R2,R10,R7   ; R2 := R10 * R7
  div  R5,R6,R12   ; R5 := R6 / R12, R15 := R6 rem R12</code></pre>
<p>The divide instruction is slightly different: it produces two results, the quotient and the remainder. The quotient is placed in the destination, but the remainder is automatically placed into R15, even though the instruction doesn’t mention R15. (What happens if you write <em>div R15,R1,R2</em>? In that case the quotient is placed into R15 and the remainder is discarded.)</p>
<p>Normally an arithmetic instruction will put a new value into the destination register, but the operand registers are left unchanged. However, what happens if one of the operands is the same as the destination, for example <em>add R7,R7,R8</em>?</p>
<p>An arithmetic instruction proceeds in three phases: (1) obtain the values in the operand registers; (2) perform the arithmetic on those values; and (3) put the result into the destination, discarding whatever value was previously there. So consider this example:</p>
<pre><code>   lea   R7,20[R0]  ; R7 := 20
   lea   R8,30[R0]  ; R8 := 30
   add   R7,R7,R8   ; R7 := R7 + R8</code></pre>
<p>After the two lea instructions have executed, R7 contains 20 and R8 contains 30. The add instruction does the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>It fetches the values in R7 and R8, obtaining 20 and 30</li>
<li>It adds the values, obtaining the result 50</li>
<li>It puts the result 50 into the destination R7, discarding the previous value.</li>
</ol>
<p>The final result is that R7 contains 50.</p>
<p>Constant data can be specified using either decimal or hexadecimal notation.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Decimal numbers are written as strings of digits, optionally preceded by a minus sign: 3,-19, 42.</p></li>
<li><p>Hexadecimal numbers are always written as four hex digits, and in assembly language programs they are indicated by putting $ before the number. Thus $00a5 and 0165 both represent the integer 165.</p></li>
</ul>
<pre><code>   lea   R1,13[R0]     ; R1 =  13 (hex 000d)
   lea   R2,$002f[R0]  ; R2 := 47 (hex 002f)
   lea   R3,$0012[R0]  ; R3 := 18 (hex 0012)
   lea   R4,0012[R0]   ; R4 := 12 (hex 000c)</code></pre>
<p>The processor page shows numbers as hex without the leading $, but in an assembly language program the $ is needed to avoid ambiguity.</p>
<p>Notice that Sigma uses := as the assignment operator; thus we write R7 := R7 + R8 (and we don’t write R7 = R7 + R8). This is because an assignment statement is profoundly different from an equation, and mathematicians have long used the = operator to indicate equations. It isn’t just an academic or theoretical point; there have been plenty of occasions where computer programmers get confused between assignment and equality, and using the wrong operator doesn’t help.</p>
<p>Why does assembly language use a notation like add R5,R2,R3 instead of R5 := R2 + R3? In short, every instruction will use a similar notation: a keyword for the operation, followed by the operands separated by commas. This notation is also related closely to the way instructions are represented in memory, which we’ll see later</p>
<p>An arithmetic instruction performs just one operation. Several instructions are needed to evaluate a larger expression. In general, you’ll need a separate instruction for every operator that appears in an expression.</p>
<p>Example: calculate 3 + 4 * 5 and put the result into R10. We have to put the numbers into registers, using lea, and then perform the arithmetic. It doesn’t matter which registers are used (as long as we avoid R0 and R15).</p>
<pre><code>    lea  R1,3[R0]   ; R1 := 3
    lea  R2,4[R0]   ; R2 := 4
    lea  R3,5[R0]   ; R3 := 5
    mul  R2,R2,R3   ; R2 := R2*R3  = 4*5
    add  R10,R1,R2  ; R10 := R1 + R2 = 3 + 4*5 = 23</code></pre>
<p>This is nearly enough to constitute a complete program. Only one more thing is needed: a way to terminate the program when it finishes. There is a special instruction to do this:</p>
<pre><code>   trap  R0,R0,R0   ; halt</code></pre>
<p>Try running this program. You can go to the Editor and type it in, but this program is part of the collection of examples built in to Sigma16. Here’s how to run it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the Examples page. Click Core, then Simple, then ConstArith. You should see the listing of the program.</li>
<li>Click Copy example to editor</li>
<li>Click Editor, and you should see the text of the program in the window.</li>
<li>Go to the Assembler page. Click Assemble.</li>
<li>Go to the Processor page. Click Boot, then Step repeatedly and watch the effect of each instruction by observing how the registers and memory are changed.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s a good idea to step through the program slowly, rather than running it to completion at full speed. The emulator will show the next instruction to be executed, highlighted in blue. Think about what the instruction should do; in particular what changes to the registers will occur? Then click Step and check to see if the right thing happened. Note that the emulator displays all values in hexadecimal notation. (Tip: this is a good way to debug programs!)</p>
<p>Generally you can use any register you like, and the choices of registers in the previous examples are arbitrary. Registers R1 through R14 are all the same. However, two of the registers are different:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>R0 contains the constant 0 and it will never change. Any time an instruction uses R0, the value it gets will be 0. It is legal for an instruction to attempt to modify R0 (for example, add R0,R3,R4 is legal) but after executing this instruction R0 still contains 0. The reason for this is that we frequently need to have access to a register containing 0.</p></li>
<li><p>R15 is used for two specific purposes. We have already seen the first: the divide instruction places the remainder into R15. The second purpose is that R15 contains the <em>condition code</em>, which is a word that contains a number of bits that provide some information about an instruction. For example, if an addition produces a result that is too large to fit in a register, a special flag indicating this is set in R15. Many of the instructions, including all the arithmetic instructions, change the value of R15 as well as placing the result in the destination register. For this reason, R15 cannot be used to hold a variable: its value would be destroyed almost immediately.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To summarise, Registers R1 through R14 are all identical and can be used for variables. R0 contains 0 and will never change. R1 changes very frequently and can be used to determine various error conditions and other information about an instruction.</p>
<p>Example</p>
<ul>
<li>Suppose we have variables a, b, c, d</li>
<li>R1=a, R2=b, R3=c, R4=d</li>
<li>We wish to compute R5 = (a+b) * (c-d)</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>    add   R6,R1,R2     ; R6 := a + b
    sub   R7,R3,R4     ; R7 := c - d
    mul   R5,R6,R7     ; R5 := (a+b) * (c-d)</code></pre>
<p>Summary.</p>
<ul>
<li>A lea instruction of the form <em>lea d,const[R0]</em> will put the constant into Rd.</li>
<li>The general form of an arithmetic instruction is <em>op d,a,b</em>.<br />
The meaning is <em>R_d := R_a op R_b</em>, and the fields are:</li>

<p>So far we have used registers in the register file to hold variables. However, there are only 16 of these, and two have special purposes (R0 and R15). That leaves only 14 registers, and most programs need more than 14 variables.</p>
<p>The computer contains another subsystem called the <em>memory</em>. This is similar in some ways to the register file. The memory contains a sequence of <em>memory locations</em>, each of which can hold a word. Each location is identifed by an <em>address</em>, and the addresses count up from 0. We will use the notation <em>mem[a]</em> to denote the memory location with address a</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The register file is used to perform calculations. In computing something like x := (2<em>a + 3</em>b) / (x-1), all the arithmetic will be done using the register file. But there are only a few registers available.</p></li>
<li><p>The memory is much larger: it contains 65,536 locations so it can hold all the variables in a program. But the memory has a limitation: the computer cannot do arithmetic directly on data in the memory.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A variable name refers to a word in memory. Actually, the variable name just stands for the address of the location which contains the variable. This allows you to refer to a variable by a name (x, sum, count) rather than an address (003c, 0104, 00d7).</p>
<p>Since we need a lot of variables, they need to be kept in memory. But since we need to do arithmetic and arithmetic can be performed only on data in registers, we adopt the following strategy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep data permanently in memory</li>
<li>When you need to do arithmetic, copy a variable from memory to a register</li>
<li>When finished, copy the result from a register back to memory</li>
</ul>
<p>Two instructions are needed to do this: * <em>load</em> copies a word from a memory location into a register. Suppose <em>xyz</em> is a variable in memory; then to copy its value into R2 we could write <em>load R2,xyz[R0]</em> * <em>store</em> copies a word from a register into a memory location. If R3 contains the result of some calculations, and we want to put it back into memory in a varaible named result, we would write <em>store R3,result[R0]</em></p>
<p>It’s necessary to write [R0] after the variable name, similarly to writing [R0] after the constant in a lea instruction. Again, the reason for that will be explained later but for now just treat it as an arbitrary rule.</p>
<p>At this point we have enough instructions to write an assignment statement in assembly language. Typically we will first write an algorithm using higher level language notation, and then translate it into instructions.</p>
<p>The problem: translate <em>x := a+b+c</em> into assembly language.</p>
<p>Solution:</p>
<pre><code>   load   R1,a[R0]      ; R1 := a
   load   R2,b[R0]      ; R2 := b
   add    R3,R1,R2      ; R3 := a+b
   load   R4,c[R0]      ; R4 := c
   add    R5,R3,R4      ; R5 := (a+b) + c
   store  R5,x[R0]      ; x := a+b+c</code></pre>
<p>Why do we have registers and memory? After all, this makes programming a little more complicated. You have to keep track of which variables are currently in registers, and you have to use load and store instructions to copy data between the registers and memory. Wouldn’t it be easier just to get rid of the distinction between registers and memory, and do all the arithmetic on memory?</p>
<p>Yes, this would be simpler. Furthermore, it’s possible to design a computer that way, and there have actually been real computers like that. However, this approach makes the computer very much slower. With modern circuits, a computer without load and store instructions (where you do arithmetic on memory locations) would run approximately 100 times slower. So nearly all modern computers do arithmetic in registers, and use instructions like load and store to copy data back and forth between registers and memory.</p>
<p>The variables used in a program need to be defined and given an initial value. This is done with the <em>data</em> statement. The variable name comes first, and it must start at the beginning of the line (no space before it). Then comes the keyword <em>data</em>, followed by the initial value, which may be written in either decimal or hexadecimal.</p>
<p>For example, to define variables x, y, z and give them initial values:</p>
<pre><code>x    data   34    ; x is a variable with initial value 34
y    data    9    ; y is initially 9
z    data    0    ; z is initially 0
abc  data  $02c6  ; specify initial value as hex</code></pre>
<p>The data statements should come <em>after</em> all the instructions in the program. This may look surprising: in some programming language you have to declare your variables at the beginning, before using them. There is a very good reason why we will put the instructions first, and the data statements after; but again the reason will come later.</p>
<p>There is a simple example of a complete program that uses load, store, and data statement. The text is given below, but you don’t need to type it in.</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the Examples page. Click Core, then Simple, then Add. You should see the listing of the program.</li>

</ul>

<h2 id="assembly-language">Assembly language</h2>
<p>The programs shown here are written in <em>assembly language</em>. The machine itself executes programs in <em>machine language</em>, which is covered later. Assembly language is translated to machine language by a program called an <em>assembler</em>.</p>
<p>The purpose of assembly language is to give the programmer absolute control over the machine language code without having to remember lots of numeric codes. For example, it is easier to remember the name “mul” for multiply than to remember the machine language code (which happens to be 3). Similarly, it’s easier to remember the names of variables (x, y, sum, total) than the numeric addresses of the memory locations that hold these variables.</p>
<p>The syntax of assembly language is simple and rigid. Every statement must fit on one line of source code; you cannot have a statement that spans several lines, and you cannot have several statements on one line.</p>
<p>Sigma16 assembly language uses a small set of characters. Any character not on this list will generate an error message. A Sigma16 program can <em>manipulate</em> any 16-bit character, but the source assembly language code is restricted to this source character set. There are many characters that look similar but are actually distinct. For example, the minus sign, the hyphen, the en-dash, and the em-dash all look similar – you have to look really closely to see the difference – but Sigma16 assembly language uses the minus sign, and the hyphens and dashes won’t work.</p>
<ul>
<li>letters: _abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ</li>
<li>digits: 0123456789</li>
<li>separators: (space) ,;</li>
<li>quotes: " ’</li>
<li>punctuation: "$<a href=""></a>+-*</li>
<li>other: &lt;=&gt;!%^&amp;{}#~@:|/'</li>
</ul>
<p>Word processors often substitute characters. For example, when you type a minus sign in a paragraph of English text, word processors may replace the minus sign with a hyphen or dash, which is correct for typeset English but incorrect for assembly language. The Sigma16 editor will insert the correct characters, as will plain text editors.</p>
<p>Each statement has a rigid format that consists of up to four <em>fields</em>. The fields must be separated by one or more spaces, and a field cannot contain a space. Every field is optional, but if a field is missing then the following fields must also be missing, except for an optional comment. The fields are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>label (optional) – If present, the label must begin in the first character of the line. If a line starts with a space, then there is no label field. A label has the same syntax as names or identifiers in many languages: it may contain letters, digits, underscores, and must begin with a letter. Both upper and lower case letters are allowed, and they syntax is case sensitive (Loop and LOOP and loop are three different labels).</p></li>
<li><p>mnemonic – This is the name of the operation: load, lea, add, sub, etc. The mnemonic must be preceded by white space, and it must be the name of a valid instruction or assembler directive.</p></li>
<li><p>operands field – the operands required by the type of statement. There are several formats possible for the operands field, depending on the instruction; these are detailed later. For example, for the add instruction the operand field must consist of three registers, separated by commas (e.g. R1,R2,R3). Spaces are not allowed in the operands field: R1,R2,R3 is fine but R1, R2, R3 is an error.</p></li>
<li><p>comments – anything that follows the operands field, or anything that appears after a semicolon, is a comment. The semicolon is not required if the mnemonic and operands fields are present, but it is good practice to include it.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some syntactically valid statements: ~~~~ loop load R1,count[R0] ; R1 = count add R1,R1,R2 ; R1 = R1 + 1 ~~~~</p>
<p>Each of the following statements is wrong!</p>
<pre><code>   add   R2, R8, R9    ; spaces in the operand field
loop1  store x[R0],R5  ; wrong order: should be R5,x[R0]
    addemup            ; invalid mnemonic
 loop2  load R1,x[R0]  ; Space before the label
    load R6,x          ; should be x[R0]</code></pre>
<p>If you forget some detail, look at one of the example programs</p>
<p>When the assembler is translating a program, it begins by looking at the spaces in order to split each statement into the four fields. This happens before it looks at the operation and operands. The assembly listing uses colors to indicate the different fields. If you get a syntax error message, the first thing to check is that the fields are what you intended. For example if you meant to say</p>
<pre><code>  add R1,R2,R3  ; x := a + b</code></pre>
<p>but you have a spurious space, like this</p>
<pre><code>  add R1, R2,R3  ; x := a + b</code></pre>
<p>the assembler will decide that the mnemonic is add, the operands field is “R1,” and all the rest - “R2,R3 ; x := a + b” – is a comment, and the colors of the text in the assembly listing will show this clearly.</p>
<p>Writing constants</p>
<p>In assembly language, you can write constants in either decimal or hexadecimal.</p>
<ul>
<li>decimal: 50</li>
<li>hexadecimal: $0032</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples:</p>
<pre><code>   lea   R1,40[R0]      ; R1 = 40
   lea   R2,$ffff[R0]   ; R2 = -1

x  data  25
y  data  $2c9e</code></pre>
<p>Correct form of operand field</p>
<ul>
<li><p>RRR: Exactly three registers separated by commas R8,R13,R0.</p></li>
<li><p>RX:Two operands: first is a register, second is an address. The address is a name or constant followed by [register]. Example: R12,array[R6]</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It isn’t enough just to get the assembler to accept your program without error messages. Your program should be clear and easy to read. This requires good style. Good style saves time writing the program and getting it to work A sloppy program looks unprofessional. Here are a few tips.</p>
<p><em>Write good comments.</em> You should use good comments in all programs, regardless of language. But comments are even more important in machine language, because the code tends to need more explanation. At the beginning of the program, use comments to give the name of the program and to say what it does. Use full line comments to say in general what’s going on, and put a comment on every instruction to explain what it’s doing.</p>
<p><em>Indent your code consistently.</em> Each field should be lined up vertically, like this:</p>
<pre><code>    load   R1,three[R0]  ; R1 = 3
    load   R2,x[R0]      ; R2 = x
    mul    R3,R1,R2      ; R3 = 3*x
    store  R3,y[R0]      ; y = 3*x
    trap   R0,R0,R0      ; stop the program</code></pre>
<p>Not like this:</p>
<pre><code>    load   R1,three[R0]     ; R1 = 3
  load  R2,x[R0] ; R2 = x
       mul R3,R1,R2           ; R3 = 3*x
 store         R3,y[R0]      ; y = 3*x
   trap  R0,R0,R0      ; stop the program</code></pre>
<p>The exact number of spaces each field is indented isn’t important; what’s important is to make the program neat and readable.</p>
<p><em>Spaces, not tabs!</em> To indent your code, always use spaces – avoid tabs! In general, never use tabs except in the (rare) cases they are actually required. The tab character was introduced long ago into computer character sets to try to mimic the tab key on old mechanical typewriters But software does not handle tab consistently. If you use tabs, your can look good in one application and like a mess in another. It’s easy to indent with spaces, and it works everywhere!</p>
<h2 id="conditionals">Conditionals</h2>
<p>Conditionals allow a program to decide which statements to execute based on Boolean expressions. One example is the if-then statement, for example:</p>
<pre><code>if x&lt;y
  then statement 1
statement 2</code></pre>
<p>A related form is the if-then-else statement:</p>
<pre><code>if x&lt;y
  then statement 1
  else statement 2
statement 3</code></pre>
<p>Conditionals are implemented in assembly language in two steps. First, a <em>comparison</em> instruction is used to produce a Boolean (i.e. either False or True). Secondly, a <em>conditional jump</em> instruction allows a choice of what instruction to execute next.</p>
<p>In Sigma16, every type of value is represented as a 16-bit word, including Booleans. If a word contains zero (hex 0000) then it represents False, and otherwise it represents True.</p>
<p>The cmplt instruction compares two integers and produces a Boolean result. Its name means “compare for less-than”. Here is an example:</p>
<pre><code>   cmplt  R5,R2,R8   ; R5 := R2 &lt; R8</code></pre>
<p>This instruction compares the two operands R2 and R8. If R2 &lt; R8 then the result is True, and the destination R5 is set to 1 (hex 0001). Otherwise, if R2 &gt;= R8, then the destination is set to 0 (hex 0000).</p>
<p>There are two more similar instructions: ~~~~ cmpeq R5,R2,R8 ; R5 := R2 = R8 cmpgt R5,R2,R8 ; R5 := R2 &gt; R8 ~~~~</p>
<p>The comments are assignments which set the destination register, and := is the assignment operator. The right hand side of each assignment is a relational expression: i.e. a comparison between two integers. For the cmpeq instruction, we are comparing for equality, and the equality operator is =. In the Sigma system, = does not mean “assign”, it means “equals”. (Some programming languages use = to mean assignment and == to mean =, which goes against centuries of standard usage in mathematics and can be confusing.)</p>
<p>The cmplt and cmpgt instructions perform integer (two’s complement) comparison:</p>
<pre><code>   lea    R1,-3[R0]  ; R1 := -3 (hex fffd)
   lea    R2,5[R0]   ; R2 := 5  (hex 0005)
   cmplt  R3,R1,R2   ; R3 := -3 &lt; 5 = True = 1 (hex 0001)</code></pre>
<p>The results would be different for natural number (binary) comparison. The word fffd represents 65,533 in binary, which is greater than 5. However, if two words are equal, the binary numbers they represent are equal and the two’s complement numbers they represent are also equal (but the binary value may be different from the two’s complement value). Thus cmpeq can be used for integer comparison and also natural comparison, whic cmplt and cmpgt only perform integer comparison.</p>
<p>Now that we can compare two numbers and put the Boolean result into a register, that Boolean can control which instructions to execute next. This is done with a <em>conditional jump</em> instruction. There are two forms: <em>jumpf</em> (jump if False) and <em>jumpt</em> (jump if True):</p>
<pre><code>         cmp   R3,R1,R2           ; R3 := R1 &lt; R2
         jumpf R3,wasFalse[R0]    ; if not R3 then goto wasNotLt
         ...                      ; execute this if R3=True              
         ...
wasFalse ...                      ; execute this if R3=False</code></pre>
<p>Both <em>jumpf</em> and <em>jumpt</em> have the same syntax as lea, load, and store. They take two operands: the first is a register and the second is a memory address. The jumpf instruction jumps to the address if the register contains False, and otherwise just skips to the next instruction. The jumpt instruction is similar, but it jumps if the register contains True.</p>
<p>Usually the address in a jump instruction – the place to jump to – is specified as a label (e.g. wasFalse) and that label appears in the label field of some instruction. You can place a label in the same line as the instruction, or it can be on a line with nothing else, in which case the label refers to the next instruction. In the following code, label1 is the address of the add instruction and label 2 is the address of the sub instruction.</p>
<pre><code>label1   add  R2,R4,R13
label2
         sub  R15,R0,R1</code></pre>
<p>If-then constructs are translated into assembly language following two similar fixed patterns. Suppose Bexp is a Boolean in any register Rd</p>
<pre><code>if Bexp
  then statement 1
statement 2</code></pre>
<p>This is translated according to the following pattern:</p>
<pre><code>       Rd := Bexp              ; usually use cmplt,cmpeq,cmpgt
       jumpf Rd,skip[R0]       ; if Bexp False, skip statement 1
       instructions for statement 1  ; only if Bexp True
skip   instructions for statement 2  ; always do this statement</code></pre>
<p>Usually a compare instruction is used to put the value of Bexp into the register, but it could also be loaded from a variable or calculated using Boolean instructions.</p>
<p>Here is an example:</p>
<pre><code>a := 93
x := 35
y := 71
if y &gt; x then a := 59
b := 104</code></pre>
<p>The corresponding assembly language is:</p>
<pre><code>; a := 93
      lea     R1,93[R0]   ; R1 := 93
      store   R1,a[R0]    ; a := 93

; x := 35
      lea     R1,35[R0]   ; R1 := 35
      store   R1,x[R0]    ; x := 35

; y := 71
      lea     R1,71[R0]   ; R1 := 71
      store   R1,x[R0]    ; x := 71

; if y &gt; x
      load    R1,y[R0]    ; R1 := y
      load    R2,x[R0]    ; R2 := x
      cmpgt   R3,R1,R2    ; R3 := y &gt; x
      jumpf   R3,skip[R0] ; if not y &gt; x then goto skip

;  then a := 59
      lea    R1,59[R0]    ; R1 := 59
      store  R1,a[R0]     ; a := 59

; b := 104
skip  lea    R1,104[R0]   ; R1 := 104
      store  R1,b[R0]     ; b := 104</code></pre>
<p>Notice the use of jumpf: if the Boolean expression is False we want to skip over the “then” part.</p>
<p>An if-then-else statement has a similar compilation pattern, but this time there are two separate parts: the “then-part” and the “else-part”. Depending on the value of the Boolean expression, one of those parts should be executed and the other should be skipped over.</p>
<p>For if-then-else, and many other control constructs, we need an <em>unconditional jump</em> which will always go to the specified address, and which doesn’t use a Boolean. The jump instruction is similar to jumpf and jumpt except that the register containing the Boolean is omitted:</p>
<pre><code>   jump   somewhere[R0]    ; go to somewhere</code></pre>
<p>The general form is</p>
<pre><code>if Bexp
  then S1
  else S2
S3  </code></pre>
<p>The pattern for translating this to assembly language is:</p>
<pre><code>   Rd := Bexp               ; put Boolean into Rd
   jumpf Rd,elsePart[R0]    ; if not Bexp then skip then-part
   instructions for S1      ; then-part of the statement
   jump   afterward[R0]     ; skip over else-part
elsePart
   instructions for S2      ; else-part of the statement
afterward
   instructions for S3</code></pre>
<h2 id="loops">Loops</h2>
<p>Loops are implemented using compilation patterns based on comparisons and jumps. The fundamental form is the <em>while loop</em>.</p>
<pre><code>while Bexp do S1
S2</code></pre>
<p>The compilation pattern is:</p>
<pre><code>loop
   Rd := Bexp
   jumpf  Rd,loopDone[R0]
   instructions for S1
   jump   loop[R0]
loopDone
   instructions for S2</code></pre>
<p>Occasionally you may encounter an infinite loop, which is sometimes expressed as a while loop:</p>
<pre><code>while true do S1</code></pre>
<p>This doesn’t need a Boolean expression; it is simply compiled into:</p>
<pre><code>loop
   instructions for S1
   jump   loop[R0] </code></pre>
<p>Infinite loops are rather rare, or at least they should be. On occasion they are exactly what is wanted. For example, operating systems contain a loop that looks for something useful to do, and then does it, and this should be an infinite loop.</p>
<p>However, there is a common but poor programming style that uses infinite loops with random break or goto statements to get out of the loop. This may be appropriate on occasion but generally it is bad style.</p>
<p>So far we have seen several compilation patterns:</p>
<ul>
<li>if-then</li>
<li>if-then-else</li>
<li>while</li>
</ul>
<p>Every high level programming construct has a compilation pattern, and they are mostly built using comparisons and jumps. In principle, these patterns are straightforward to use. However, there are two issues that require a little care: uniqueness of labels and nested statements.</p>
<p>Labels must be unique: the same one cannot be used twice in the same program, and if it is, the assembler will give an error message. This means that you cannot follow the compilation patterns blindly. If you use “loop” as the label for a while loop, as in the pattern above, you need a different label for your next while loop.</p>
<p>The best approach here is not to use labels like loop, loop1, loop2. It’s far better to think about the <em>purpose</em> of the construct in your program and to use a label that reflects this purpose.</p>
<p>Another complication is that most programs contain <em>nested statements</em>. These are statements that contain smaller statements, and the containment may go several levels deep.</p>
<pre><code>if b1
  then S1
       if b2 then S2 else S3
       S4
  else S5;
       while b3 do S6
S7</code></pre>
<p>There is an important principle to follow here: every time a statement appears in a compilation pattern (we have been calling them S1, S2, S3, etc.), it should be translated as a <em>block</em>.</p>
<p>A block is a sequence of instructions which <em>always</em> begins execution at the first instruction, and <em>always</em> finishes at the end. You <em>never</em> jump into the middle of it, and it <em>never</em> jumps out of the middle to some other place.</p>
<p>Every statement should be compiled into a block of code. This block may contain internal structure — it may contain several smaller blocks — but to execute it you should always begin at the beginning and it should always finish at the end.</p>
<p>In programming language theory, programming with blocks is often considered to be good practice or good style. But it is more than just an issue of style. If you always treat the statements inside compilation patterns as blocks, the patterns will “just work”, no matter how deeply nested they are. If you violate the block structure, you will find the program extremely difficult to get to work.</p>
<h2 id="machine-language">Machine language</h2>
<p>The actual bits representing an instruction (written in hex) (e.g 0d69) are <em>machine language</em>. The actual hardware runs the machine language — it’s just looking at the numbers. The text notation with names – e.g. add R13,R6,R9 – is called assembly language. Assembly language is for humans to read and write; machine language is for machines to execute. Both languages specify the program in complete detail, down to the last bit</p>
<p>As a program is running, the memory contains all your program’s data: the variables, data structures, arrays, lists, etc. <em>The memory also contains the machine language program itself.</em> The program is stored inside the computer’s main memory, along with the data. This concept is called <em>the stored program computer</em>.</p>
<p>There is an alternative approach: a computer can be designed to have one memory to hold the data, and a completely separate memory to hold the program. This approach is often used for special-purpose computers (primarily micro-controllers), but experience has shown this to be inferior for general purpose computers.</p>
<p>Instruction formats: different types of instruction</p>
<p>Sigma16 has several instruction formats</p>
<ul>
<li> instructions use the </li>
<li> instructions use the </li>
<li> instructions use </li>
</ul>
<p>Each kind of instruction is called an instruction format. All the instructions with the same format are similar Each instruction format has a standard representation in the memory.</p>
<p>The machine language program is in the memory So we need to represent each instruction as a word An instruction format is a systematic way to represent an instruction using a string of bits, on one or more words. Every instruction is either RRR, RX, or EXP</p>
<ul>
<li>An RRR instruction is represented in one word (recall that a word is 16 bits).</li>
<li>An RX instruction is represented in two words.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fields of an instruction word</p>
<p>An instruction word has 16 bits. There are four fields, each 4 bits. We write the value in a field using hexadecimal. hex digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, a, b, c, d, e, f. These correspond to 0, 1, …, 15</p>
<p>The names of the fields are:</p>
<ul>
<li>op – holds the operation code</li>
<li>d – usually holds the destination register</li>
<li>a – usually holds the first source operand register</li>
<li>b – usually holds the second source operand register</li>
</ul>
<p>Representing RRR instructions</p>
<p>Every RRR instruction consists of</p>
<ul>
<li>An operation (e.g. add)</li>
<li>Three register operands: a destination and two operands</li>
<li>The instruction performs the operation on the operands and puts the result in the destination</li>
</ul>
<p>Example: add R3,R12,R5. We need to specify  RRR instruction this is. Is it add? sub? mul? another? This is done with an operation code — a number that says what the operation is. There are about a dozen RRR instructions, so a 4-bit operation code suffices. We also need to specify three registers: destination and two source operands. There are 16 registers, so a particular one can be specified by 4 bits. Total requirements: 4 fields, each 4 bits — total 16 bits. An RRR instruction exactly fills one word.</p>
<p>All RRR instructions have the same form, just the operation differs</p>
<ul>
<li>add R2,R2,R5 ; R2 = R2 + R5</li>
<li>sub R3,R1,R3 ; R3 = R1 - R3</li>
<li>mul R8,R6,R7 ; R8 = R6 * R7</li>
</ul>
<p>In add R2,R5,R9 we call R5 the first operand, R9 the second operand, and R2 the destination. It’s ok to use the same register as an operand and destination! Later we’ll see some more RRR instructions, obut they all have the same form as these do.</p>
<p>Here are the RRR operation codes:</p>

<p>Don’t memorise this table! You just need to understand how it’s used.</p>
<p>Example of RRR:</p>
<pre><code>add  R13,R6,R9</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>The opcode (operation code) is 0</li>
<li>Destination register is 13 (hex d)</li>
<li>Source operand registers are 6 and 9 (hex 6 and 9)</li>
<li>So the instruction is 0d69</li>
</ul>
<p>Representing RX instructions</p>
<p>Every RX instruction contains two operands:</p>
<ul>
<li>A </li>
<li>A </li>
</ul>
<p>We have seen several so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>lea R5,19[R0] ; R5 = 19</li>
<li>load R1,x[R0] ; R1 = x</li>
<li>store R3,z[R0] ; z = R3</li>
<li><p>jump finished[R0] ; goto finished</p></li>
<li>The first operand (e.g. R1 here) is called the destination register, just like for RRR instructions</li>
<li>The second operand x[R0] specifies a memory address</li>
<li><p>Each variable is kept in memory at a specific location which is identified by its address</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The memory operand has two parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>The variable x is a name for the address where x is kept — called the displacement.</li>
<li>The R0 part is just a register, called the index register.</li>
</ul>
<p>Format of RX instruction ~~~~ load R1,x[R0] ~~~~</p>
<p>There are two words in the machine language code. The first word has 4 fields: op, d, a, b, where</p>
<ul>
<li>op contains f for every RX instruction</li>
<li>d contains the register operand (in the example, 1)</li>
<li>a contains the index register (in the example, 0)</li>
<li>b contains a code indicating  RX instruction this is (1 means load)</li>
</ul>
<p>The second word contains the <em>displacement</em>. In the example, this is the address of x. Suppose x has memory address 0008. Then the machine code for load R1,x[R0] is:</p>
<pre><code>f101
0008</code></pre>
<p>Operation codes for RX instructions</p>
<p>Recall, for RRR the op field contains a number saying which RRR instruction it is. For RX, the op field always contains f. So how does the machine know which RX instruction it is? Answer: there is a secondary code in the b field.</p>
<p>mnemonic secondary opcode in b field ~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ lea 0 load 1 store 2</p>
<h1 id="architecture">Architecture</h1>
<p>Our focus is on fundamental concepts, ideas and principles. Sigma16 illustrates the fundementals of computer systems but it avoids unnecessary complexity. For example, Sigma16 has just one word size (16 bits) while most commercial machines provide a variety. That variety is useful for practical applications but it complicates many of the details while not adding any new fundamental ideas. Most commercial computers that achieve success in the marketplace eventually become encrusted with complications that help support backward compatibility; this can lead to great complexity.</p>
<h2 id="data-representation-and-notation">Data representation and notation</h2>
<p>Sigma16 is a 16-bit architecture, and every data value is a 16-bit word. Integers are represented in 16-bit two’s complement notation. The bits of a word are numbered from left to right, starting with 0. Thus the leftmost (most significant) bit of a word is bit 0, and the rightmost (least significant) is bit 15.</p>
<p>The value of a word can be written in several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>An unsigned integer between 0 and 65,535 (2^16 - 1)</li>
<li>A signed integer between -32,768 and 32,767 (-2^15 and 2^15 - 1)</li>
<li>A 4-digit hexadecimal constant, where the digits are 0-9 a-f. Sometimes, when the context is clear, this is written as just the hex digits (e.g 3b2f). In assembly language programs, hex constants are written with a preceding $ sign (e.g. $3b2f). This is necessary to avoid ambiguity: 1234 is a decimal number and $1234 is a hexadecimal number. In contexts where there is no ambiguiity, the $ may be omitted: for example, the GUi shows register and memory contents as hexadecimal without the leading $.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some machine operations act on individual bits in a word. We will use the notation word.n to indicate bit n in the word, where the bits are numbered from 0 at the left (most significant) position up to 15 at the rightmost (least significant) position. For example the fourth bit of R15 can be written as R15.3.</p>
<p>A <em>field</em> is a consecutiave sequence of bits within a word. For example, we will later define a field named <em>op</em> which consists of bits 0-3 of a word; this means the leftmost four bits of the word.</p>
<h2 id="overview-of-the-subsystems">Overview of the subsystems</h2>
<p>The system contains several main subsystems. The most important of these are <em>registers</em>, <em>memory</em>, and <em>logic and arithmetic</em>, and <em>Input/Output</em>. These are described in detail later, but here is a brief synopsis:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A register is a digital circuit that can retain one word of data. A new value can be loaded into a register, and the current contents may be read out. There are a number of special registers as well as a <em>register file</em> that contains 16 registers.</p></li>
<li><p>The memory can hold a large number of words. It’s similar to the register file, but significantly slower and much larger.</p></li>
<li><p>The ALU (arithmetic and logic unit) is a circuit that can do arithmetic, such as addition, subtraction, comparison, and some other operations</p></li>
<li><p>The Input/Output system can transfer data between the computer and the outside world.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="register-file">Register file</h2>
<p>The <strong>register file</strong> is a set of 16 general registers that hold a 16 bit word. A register is referenced by a 4-bit binary number. In assembly language, we use the notations R0, R1, R2, …, R9, R10, R11, R12, R13, R14, R15 to refer to the registers. The state of the register file can be written as a table showing the value of each register:</p>
<p>Register Contents ~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~ R0 0000 R1 fffe R2 13c4 … … R14 03c8 R15 0020</p>
<p>Sigma16 is a load/store style architecture; that is, it does not combine memory accesses with arithmetic. All calculations are carried out in the register file, and explicit load and store instructions must be used to copy data between the memory and the register file.</p>
<p>There are some programming conventions that use certain registers for special purposes. The hardware does not enforce, or even know about, these conventions, and you do not have to follow the conventions in programming. However, it is necessary to obey the conventions in order to use the standard software libraries in your program. See the section on Programming for a discussion of these standard usage conventions.</p>
<p><strong>R0 holds the constant 0</strong></p>
<p>One of the registers, R0, has a special property: it always contains the constant 0. It is legal to perform an instruction that attempts to load some other value into R0, but the register will still contain 0 after executing such an instruction. Such an instruction will simply have no lasting effect.</p>
<p><strong>R15 is the condition code register</strong></p>
<p>Several instructions produce status information: the result of a comparison, whether there was an overflow, etc. This information is automatically loaded into R15, which is the condition code register. The description of each instruction states whether R15 is modified, and what goes into it.</p>
<p>The bits in R15 are indexed from bit 0 (the most significant, or lefttmost bit) to bit 15 (the least significant, or rightmost). The condition code bits that have specific meanings are called <em>flags</em>.</p>

<h2 id="memory">Memory</h2>
<p>The memory is a hardware array of words that are accessed by address. A memory address is 16 bits wide, and there is one memory location corresponding to each address, so there are 2^16 = 64k memory locations. Each memory location is a 16-bit word.</p>
<p>Instructions specify memory addresses in two parts: the <em>displacement</em>, which is a word representing a binary number, and the <em>index</em>, which is one of the registers in the register file. For example, a memory address could be specified as $003c[R5]; the displacement is 003c and the index is R5.</p>
<p>When the instruction is executed, the computer calculates the <em>effective address</em> by adding the value of the displacement and the value in the index register. If R5 contains 2, then the effective address of $003c[R5] is 003e.</p>
<p>This scheme may seem more complicated than simply specifying the address directly, but it is extraordinarily flexible. If the machine language just gave the address as a single binary number, it would be limited to accessing simple static variables. The effective address mechanism is simple to implement in hardware, as you can see in the digital circuit processor, yet it allows the implementation of local variables, records, arrays, pointers and linked data structures, jump tables, and more. These techniques are described later.</p>
<h2 id="control-registers">Control registers</h2>
<p>There are several instruction control registers that enable the processor to keep track of the state of the running program. These registers are rarely used directly by the machine language program, but they are essential for keeping track of the execution of the program, and some instructions use them directly.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>ir – instruction register (16-bit word)</p></li>
<li><p>pc – program counter (16-bit word)</p></li>
<li><p>adr – address register (16-bit word)</p></li>
<li><p>dat – data register (16-bit word)</p></li>
<li><p>status – collection of control flags</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="status-register-flags">Status register flags</h3>
<p>The processor can be executing in several modes, which are determined by the <strong>system control registers</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="instruction-representation">Instruction representation</h2>
<p>Instructions are represented in the memory of the computer using words, just like all other kinds of data. From the programmer’s perspective, an instruction is like a simple statement in a programming language. From the circuit designer’s perspective, however, instructions must be processed using logic gates, and the specific way it is represented as a word of bits is important.</p>
<p>An instruction specifies several pieces of information. For example, add R1,R2,R3 is an instruction that says four things: it’s an addition, the result goes into R1, and the operands come from R2 and R3. Therefore to represent instructions we need to organize a word as a collection of several <em>fields</em>, with each field giving one specific piece of information about the instruction.</p>
<p>The particular scheme for describing an instruction as a collection of fields is called an <em>instruction format</em>. Like most computers, Sigma16 has a small number of instruction formats and a larger number of instructions. The key to understanding the interface between machine language and digital circuit design is to master the instruction formats.</p>
<p>The core architecture (the simplest part of the system) uses just the <strong>RRR format</strong> (for instructions that perform operations in the registers) and the <strong>RX format</strong> (for instructions that refer to a memory location.)</p>
<p>The advanced parts of the architecture provide additional instructions which are represented with the EXP format. There are several sub-formats, or variations, of the EXP format which are described in more detail below. The name EXP stands simultaneously for <em>expansion</em> (because it provides for many additional instructions) and <em>experimental</em> (because it allows for experimentation with the design and implementation of new instructions).</p>
<h3 id="instruction-fields">Instruction fields</h3>
<p>An instruction may consist of one word or two words, depending on the instruction format. These words are subdivided into 4-bit <em>fields</em>, each with a unique name.</p>
<p>First word of the instruction:</p>
<table class="wordlayout"">
<tr>
<th>op</th>
<th>d</th>
<th>a</th>
<th>b</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>0-3</td>
<td>4-7</td>
<td>8-11</td>
<td>12-15</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Second word of the instruction (if there is a second word):</p>
<table class="wordlayout"">
  <tr>
    <th>e</th>
    <th>f</th>
    <th>g</th>
    <th>h</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>0-3</td>
    <td>4-7</td>
    <td>8-11</td>
    <td>12-15</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Some instruction formats combine two of the 4-bit fields to form a larger field:</p>
<ul>
<li>The a and b fields may be combined to form an 8-bit field called ab (only for the EXP formats)</li>
<li>The g and h fields may be combined to form an 8-bit field called gh</li>
<li>The e, f, g, h fields may be combined to form a 16-bit field called disp</li>
</ul>
<table class="wordlayout"">
 <tr>
  <th>op</th>
  <th>d</th>
  <th>a</th>
  <th>b</th>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>0-3</td>
  <td>4-7</td>
  <td>8-11</td>
  <td>12-15</td>
 </tr>
</table>
<p>Every instruction has a 4-bit field called the opcode (op for short). This gives 16 values of the opcode: 14 of them (0 through 13) denote the 14 RRR instructions, described later. If the op field is 14 (hex e) the instruction is EXP format and has a secondary opcode in the a and b fields. If the op field contains 15 (hex f) the instruction is RX format with a secondary opcode in the b field. The instruction formats are described below.</p>
<p>The first word of every instruction contains the following fields.</p>
<ul>
<li>op (bits 0-3) opcode, determines instruction format</li>
<li>d (bits 4-7) 4-bit destination</li>
<li>a (bits 8-11) 4-bit operand</li>
<li>b (bits 12-15) 4-bit operand, or expanded opcode for RX</li>
<li>ab (bits 8-15) 8-bit expanded opcode for EXP</li>
</ul>
<p>A second word is needed to represent RX, EXP4 and EXP8 formats. There are individual names for the individual 4-bit fields, as well as names (disp, gh) for larger fields.</p>
<ul>
<li>e (bits 0-3) 4-bit operand</li>
<li>f (bits 4-7) 4-bit operand</li>
<li>g (bits 8-11) 4-bit operand</li>
<li>h (bits 12-15) 4-bit operand</li>
<li>gh (bits 8-15) 8-bit operand</li>
<li>disp (bits 0-15) 16 bit operand “displacement”</li>
</ul>
<p>There are two kinds of format: the machine instruction formats, and the assembly language instruction statement formats. There are three machine instruction formats: RRR, RX, EXP0, EXP4, EXP8. However, there is a larger set of assembly language statement formats, because there are special syntaxes for some instructions, and there are assembler directives that aren’t instructions at all. The assembly language formats are described later.</p>
<p>The core architecture has only two instruction formats: RRR and RX.</p>
<h3 id="rrr-format">RRR format</h3>
<p>RRR instructions perform operations on data in registers, but not referring to memory. The representation is one word.</p>
<p>RRR instructions: op is the operation code which determines the instruction; op must be between 0 and 13 (hex 0 to hex d). The destination register is Rd, the operands are Ra and Rb.</p>
<p>An RRR instruction contains an operation code (op), and specifies three operands registers using the d, sa, and sb fields. It is represented as one word, which is divided into four fields:</p>
<ul>
<li>op (4 bits, starting from bit 0) Operation code</li>
<li>d (4 bits, starting from bit 4) Destination register</li>
<li>sa (4 bits, starting from bit 8) Source a register</li>
<li>sb (4 bits, starting from bit 12) Source b register</li>
</ul>
<table class="wordlayout"">
  <tr>
    <th>op</th>
    <th>d</th>
    <th>a</th>
    <th>b</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>0-3</td>
    <td>4-7</td>
    <td>8-11</td>
    <td>12-15</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The op field of an RRR instruction must be in the range from 0 through 13 (hex 0 through d). This allows for a total of 14 distinct RRR instructions. If the op field is outside this range, it indicates an “expanding opcode”: 14 (hex e) indicates the EXP format, and 15 (hex f) indicates the RX format.</p>
<p>A RRR instruction is written with an instruction name (menonic) and three register operands. For example, the “trap” instruction has mnemonic 13 (and the hex value of 13 is d), so the assembly language “trap R4,R12,R2” is translated to machine language as d4c2.</p>
<p>In most cases, an RRR instruction takes two operands in registers specified by the a and b fields and produces a result which is loaded into the register specified by the d field. A typical example of an RRR instruction is add R4,R9,R2, which adds the contenst of registers R9 and R2, and loads the result into R4. It’s equivalent to R4 := R9 + R2.</p>
<h3 id="rx-format">RX format</h3>
<p>RX instructions that specify a memory location as well as a register operand. The representation is two words.</p>
<p>RX instructions are two words, where op=15, b contains the secondary opcode which specifies which RX instruction it is, d is the destination, a is the index register, and the second word is a 16 bit constant called the displacement (often written disp for short).</p>
<pre><code>---------------------
| op |  d |  a |  b |
---------------------
|    displacement   |
---------------------</code></pre>
<p>The RX instruction format is used for instructions that use a memory address, which is specified by an index register and a displacement. The name of the format describes briefly the two operands: a register (R) and an indexed memory address (X).</p>
<p>An RX instruction contains two operands: one is a memory address, and the other is a register. Typical RX instructions are loads, stores, and jumps. The instruction consists of two consecutive words. The first has the same format as an RRR instruction, with four fields: op, d, sa, sb. The second word is a single 16-bit binary number, and is called the displacement.</p>
<p>The memory address is specified in two parts: an index register and the displacement. The index register is specified in the sa field. In assembly language, the notation used is number[reg], where the number is the value of the displacement, and the reg is the index register. Thus $20b3[R2] means the address has displacement $20b3 and the index register is R2.</p>
<p>When the machine executes an RX instruction, it begins by calculating the effective address. This is abbreviated “ea”, and its value is the sum of the displacement and the contents of the index register.</p>
<p>RX instructions are represented in two words, and they use an “expanding opcode”. That is, the op field of the first word of the instruction contains the constant f (the bits 1111) for every RX instruction, and the sb field is used to hold a secondary opcode indicating which RX instruction it is.</p>
<p>The register operand is specified in the d field. For several RX instructions, this is indeed the destination of the instruction: for example, load places data into Rd. However, a few RX instructions use the d field differently (see, for example, the conditional jump instructions).</p>
<p>The memory address is specified using the sa field and the displacement, which is the entire second word of the instruction.</p>
<ul>
<li>op field (bits 0-3 of ir) is f for all RX instructions</li>
<li>d field (bits 4-7 of ir) has several uses</li>
<li>a field (bits 8-11 of ir) is index register for effective address</li>
<li>b field (bits 12-15 of ir) is secondary opcode</li>
<li>disp (displacement) is the second word of the instruction</li>
<li>ea (effective address) = displacement + r[a]</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="exp0-format">EXP0 format</h3>
<p>An EXP0 instruction is one word, and only one operand field (the d field) is available. (There are 0 fields in the second word; hence the name EXP0.) The op field contains e, and the a and b fields are combined to form an 8-bit opcode.</p>
<p>An EXP instruction contains 14 (hex e) in the op field, and the a and b fields are combined into a single 8-bit number that contains a secondary opcode. This means that the EXP format allows for 256 instructions. This greatly expands the number of instructions that can be accommodated, and it allows for experimental instructions for research purposes. (The name EXP stands simultaneously for both EXPansion and EXPerimentation.)</p>
<p>The EXP0 format is one word, where op=14 (hex e) and the a and b fields are combined into an 8-bit secondary operation code. There is only one operand, Rd.</p>
<p>EXP0 format takes no operands. The instruction format uses just one word (there is no second word with the e, f, g, h fields). The op field contains 14 (hex e), the d field is ignored (the assembler sets it to 0), and the ab field contains an 8 bit expanded operation code. Example: <em>rfi</em> is an instruction with no operands and with secondary opcode 0. Its representation is e000. The EXP0 format allows rfi to be represented in one word without using up one of the limited and valuable opcodes avaiable for RRR instructions.</p>

<h3 id="exp4-format">EXP4 format</h3>
<p>An EXP4 instruction instruction is two words, with a 4-bit operand in the first word and four more in the second word. (It’s called EXP4 because the second word contains 4 4-bit operands.)</p>
<p>The EXP4 format is two words. As with all EXP instructions, ab gives an expanded operation code. In EXP4, the second word contains four 4-bit fields e, f, g, h, which may contain register numbers or 4-bit constants.</p>

<h3 id="assembly-language-statement-formats">Assembly language statement formats</h3>
<p>Assembly language statements generally correspond to the instruction formats, but there is not an exact correspondence for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Sometimes an instruction is written in assembly language with a field omitted which exists in the machine language code but is ignored. For example, the instruction <em>inv R1,R2</em> generates an RRR instruction, but the third operand field is omitted because the invert function takes only one operand, not two.</p></li>
<li><p>Sometimes two instructions look the same in assembly language but use different machine language instruction formats. For example, <em>add R1,R2,R3</em> and <em>push R1,R2,R3</em> look similar, but <em>add</em> uses the RRR instruction format and <em>push</em> uses the EXP4 instruction format. The reason for this is that there are not enough bits in the op field to accommodate all the instructions with three register operands, so an <em>expanding opcode</em> is used. Thus push is represented with op=14 (indicating EXP format), and the EXP4 variant is used for this instruction.</p></li>
<li><p>The 4-bit fields are sometimes used to denote a register from the register file (R3), or a control register (mask), or a constant . In assembly language the constants are written just as a number (e.g. shiftl R1,R2,5). Control registers are written by name rather than their number in the control register file (e.g. getctl R3,mask).</p></li>

<p>An EXP instruction may use the fields op, d, ab, e, f, g, h. The g and h fields can be combined into a single 8-bit field gh All EXP instructions combine the a and b fields into a single 8-bit field called ab. Some EXP instructions combine the g and h fields into a single 8-bit field called gh.</p>
<p>The EXP format has the following variants.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The RREXP format takes two register operands, which are in the e and f fields of the second word. The d field of the first word and the g and h fields of the second word are ignored (the assembler will set these to 0). Any RREXP instruction could be reprsented as RRR, but there are only a few RRR opcodes avaiable, so uncommon instructions that require two registers are represented as RREXP. Example: <em>execute R5,R6</em> is RREXP.</p></li>
<li><p>The RCEXP format takes two register operands; the first is a general register and the second is a control register. An example of the operand field is <em>R3,mask</em>. The operands are in the e and f fields of the second word. The d field of the first word and the g and h fields of the second word are ignored (the assembler will set these to 0.) The first operand is an element of the register file (for example, R4). The second operand is a control register, which is specified by a 4-bit number. In assembly language, we normally refer to the control registers by name rather than number, to make it easier to remember which is which. For example, <em>getctl R3,status</em> has RCEXP format.</p></li>
<li><p>The RRREXP format takes three register operands, which are in the f, g, and h fields of the second word. An example of the operand field is $R1,R2,R3<em>. The d field of the first word and the e field of the second word are ignored (the assembler will set these to 0). The RRREXP instructions would be a natural fit for the RRR format, but there are not enough RRR opcodes available, so the EXP format is used to expand the number of instructions that can be represented. For example, </em>push R5,R8,R9* has RRREXP format.</p></li>
<li><p>The RRKEXP format takes two register operands and a 4-bit constant number. An example of the operand field is <em>R1,R2,13</em>. The register operands are in the f and g fields of the second word, and constant is in the h field of the second word. The d field of the first word and the e field of the second word are ignored (the assembler sets these to 0). For example, <em>shiftr R3,R6,7</em> has RRKEXP format.</p></li>
<li><p>The RRKKEXP format takes two register operands and two 4-bit constant binary number operands. The register operands are in the e and f fields of the second word, while the two constants are in the g and h fields. The d field of the first word is ignored (the assembler sets it to 0).</p></li>
<li><p>The RRXEXP format takes two register operands as well as a memory address specified with an 8-bit offset and index register. Thus these instructions require three registers to be specified, as well as the offset. Thus every bit of both instruction words is needed to represent an RRXEXP format instruction. In assembly language, the memory address is written as <em>offset[Rh]</em> where <em>offset</em> is an -bit binary number and Rh is a register. The effective memory address is <em>offset+Rh</em>. This is similar to ordinary memory addresses; the only difference is that it uses an 8-bit offset rather than a 16-bit displacement. For example, <em>save R1,R9,2[R14]</em> has RRKEXP format.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="instruction-set">Instruction set</h1>
<p>The following sections describe the instructions in groups organized by their function. Some of the groups contain instructions with different formats. From the programmer’s perspective the function is more important, so these groups are useful in finding the right instruction to use. (From the perspective of designing a digital circuit to impleemnt the architecture, the format is essential.)</p>
<h2 id="arithmetic-instructions">Arithmetic instructions</h2>
<p>The add instruction can be used for both binary addition (on natural numbers) and for two’s complement addition (on signed integers).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>16-bit natural numbers are unsigned integers 0, 1, 2, …, 65535. If two natural numbers are added, the result is a natural number (the result cannot be negative). If the result is 65536 or larger, it cannot be represented as a 16 bit binary number. If this happens, the destination register is set to the lower 16 bits of the true result, and the binary overflow flag is set in the Condition Code.</p></li>
<li><p>16-bit two’s complement numbers are signed integers -32999?, …, -1, 0, 1, …, 32???. If two signed integers are added, the result is a signed integer. If the result is less than -32000 or greater than 32000, then the result cannot be represented as a 16 bit two’s complement number. If this happens, the destination register is set to the lower 16 bits of the true result, and the two’s complement overflow flag is set in the Condition Code. Furthermore, the overflow flag is set in the req register. If interrupts are enabled and the overflow flag is 1 in the mask register, then an interrupt will occur immediatelhy after the add instruction executes.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="add">add</h3>
<p>Example: add R1,R2,R3 ; R1 := R2 + R3</p>
<p>The instruction add Rd,Ra,Rb has operands Ra and Rb and destination Rd. It fetches the operands Ra and Rb, calculates the sum Ra + Rb, and loads the result into the destination Rd. The effect is Rd := Ra + Rb. For example, add R5,R12,R2 performs R5 := R12 + R3.</p>
<p>The add instruction is RRR format with opcode=0. Given destination Rd and operands Ra and Rb (where d, a, b are hex digits), add Rd,Ra,Rb is reprseented by 0dab.</p>

<p>If the magnitude of the product is too large to be representable as a 16 bit two’s complement integer, this is an overflow. If overflow occurs, the integer overflow bit is set in the condition code (F15) and the integer overflow bit is also set in the interrupt request register (req), and the lower order 16 bits of the product are loaded into Rd.</p>

<h3 id="div">div</h3>
<p>Example: div R1,R2,R3 ; R1 := R2 / R3, R15 := R2 rem R3</p>
<p>Unlike the other arithmetic operations, the divide instruction div Rd,Ra,Rb produces two results: the quotient Ra / Rb and the remainder Ra rem Rb. It loads the quotient into the destination register Rd, and the remainder is loaded into R15.</p>
<p>If the destination register Rd is actually R15, then the quotient is placed in R15, and the remainder is discarded.</p>
<p>The divide instruction doesn’t set the condition code, since R15 is used for the remainder. Therefore there is no condition code bit to indicate division by 0. However, it is easy for a program to detect a division by 0.</p>
<ul>
<li>(Explicit test for error) The program can compare the divisor with 0 before or after executing the divide instruction, and jump to an error handler if the divisor is 0. This is similar to testing the condition code after an add, sub, or mul instruction, but it does require two instructions: a compare followed by a conditional jump. For example:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>   div   R1,R2,R3       ; R1 := R2/R3, R15 := R2 rem R3
   cmpeq R4,R3,R0       ; Did we divide by 0?
   jumpt zeroDivide[R0] ; If yes, handle error</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>(Exception) The program can detect division by 0 using an interrupt. To do this, enable interrupts and enable the interrupt mask for division by 0. See the section on Interrupts. This approach does not require a compare or jump instruction for each division.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="addc">addc</h3>
<p>The <strong>binary add with carry</strong> instruction <em>addc Rd,Re,Rf</em> calculates the sum of the binary numbers in the operand registers Re and Rf as well as the carry bit in the condition code. The sum is loaded into the destination register Rd and the carry output is set in the condition code register. Overflow is not possible with this instruction.</p>
<h2 id="accessing-memory">Accessing memory</h2>
<p>A memory address is a 16-bit binary number. Instructions don’t specify addresses directly; they specify an address with two components: a <em>displacement</em> and an <em>index</em>, written as “displacement[index]”. The displacement is a 16 bit constant, and in assembly language it may be given as a decimal integer, a hexadecimal word, or a label. The index is a register. For example,$0c45[R5] has a displacement of 0c45 and an index of R5.</p>
<p>When an instruction executes, the machine takes the displacement and index and calculates the <em>effective address</em>. This is defined to be the binary sum of the displacement and the curent value in the index register. In the example above, if R5 contains 3, then the effective address of $0c45[R5] is $0c48.</p>
<p>If you just want to specify an address <em>a</em> in an instruction, this can be written as “a[R0]”. Since R0 contains the constant 0, the effective address is just <em>a</em>.</p>
<h3 id="lea">lea</h3>
<p>The <strong>load effective address</strong> instruction <em>lea Rd,disp[Rx]</em> calculates the effective address of the operand disp[Rx] and places the result in the destination register Rd. The effective address is the binary sum disp+Rx.</p>
<h3 id="load">load</h3>
<p>The <strong>load</strong> instruction <em>load Rd,disp[Rx]</em> calculates the effective address of the operand disp[Rx] and copies the word in memory at the effective address into the destination register Rd. The effective address is the binary sum disp+Rx.</p>

<p>Store copies the word in the destination register into memory at the effective address. This instruction is unusual in that it treats the “destination register” as the source of data, and the actual destination which is modified is the memory location.</p>
<p>Most instructions take data from the rightmost operands and modify the leftmost destination, just like an assignment statement (x := y+z). However, the store instruction operates in the opposite direction. The reason for this has to do with the circuit design of the processor. Although the “left to right” nature of the store instruction may look inconsistent from the programmer’s point of view, it actually is more consistent from the deeper perspective of circuit design.</p>
<p>Examples</p>
<pre><code>   store  R3,$2b8e[R5]
   store  R12,count[R0]
   store  R6,arrayX[R2]</code></pre>
<h3 id="save">save</h3>
<p>Example: save R2,R9,20[R14] is equivalent to</p>
<pre><code>  store  R2,20[R14]
  store  R3,21[R14]
  store  R4,22[R14]
  store  R5,23[R14]
  store  R6,24[R14]
  store  R7,25[R14]
  store  R8,26[R14]
  store  R9,27[R14]</code></pre>
<p>The <strong>save</strong> instruction stores a sequence of adjacent registers into memory starting from the effective address. The index register (R14 in this example) is not changed. Save is equivalent to a fixed sequence of store instructions; its purpose of save is to copy the state of registers into memory during a procedure call or a context switch.</p>
<p>Typically, save is used as part of a procedure call and restore is used as part of the return.</p>
<p>The instruction <em>save Re,Rf,gh[Ra]</em> stores the contents of Re, Re+1, …, Rf into memory at consecutive locations beginning with <em>mem[Ra+gh]</em>.</p>
<p>The instruction is EXP format, and the offset is limited to 8 bits, because it is specified in the <em>gh</em> field, which is the rightmost 8 bits of the second word of the instruction. The secondary opcode is 8, which is in the ab field of the first word of the instruction.</p>
<p>The first register to be saved is in the <em>e</em> field, and the last register to be saved is in the <em>f</em> field. The instruction always stores at least one register. If <em>e</em> and <em>f</em> are the same, for example <em>save R5,R5,0[F14]</em> then that register (R5 in the example) is stored. If <em>e</em> &gt; <em>f</em> then the register numbers wrap around For example,</p>
<pre><code>   save    R11,R3,3[R5]</code></pre>
<p>is equivalent to ~~~~ store R11,3[R5] store R12,4[R5] store R13,5[R5] store R14,6[R5] store R15,7[R5] store R0,8[R5] store R1,9[R5] store R2,10[R5] store R3,11[R5] ~~~~</p>

<p>The <strong>restore</strong> instruction copies a sequence of consecutive memory locations starting from the effecive address into a sequence of adjacent registers.

<p>The instruction <em>restore Re,Rf,gh[Rd]</em> copies the contents of memory at consecutive locations beginning with mem[gh+Rf] into registers Re, Re+1, …, Rf.</p>
<p>The instruction is EXP format, and the displacement is limited to 8 bits, because it is specified in the gh field (the rightmost 8 bits) of the second word of the instruction. The secondary opcode is 9, which is in the ab field of the first word of the instruction. The assembly language statement format is RRXEXP.</p>
<p>For example, consider this instruction: ~~~~ restore R3,R10,4[R14] ~~~~</p>
<p>The effect is equivalent to</p>
<pre><code>   load  R3,4[R14]
   load  R4,5[R14]
   load  R5,6[R14]
   load  R6,7[R14]
   load  R7,8[R14]
   load  R8,9[R14]
   load  R9,10[R14]
   load  R10,11[R14]</code></pre>
<h3 id="push">push</h3>
<p>Push a word onto a stack.</p>
<p>Example: push R1,R2,R3 pushes value in R1 onto stack with R2 = current top and R3 = last address in stack.</p>
<p>Push the word in R1 onto a stack with top R2 and limit R3. If the stack is full, nothing is stored into memory and an error is indicated in the condition code and interrupt request registers; an interrupt will occur if interrupts are enabled and the stack mask bit is set.</p>
<p>Push has the following semantics:</p>
<p>if R2&lt;R3 then R2 := R2+1; mem[R2] := R1 else R15.sovfl := 1, req.sovfl := 1</p>
<p>If R2 = R3 this means the stack completely fills the block, and there is no space to store a new element. In this case, the push instruction does not store R1: it doesn’t modify memory outside the block, and it doesn’t overwrite data in the stack. Instead, the instruction indicates a stack overflow by setting the sovfl (stack overflow) bit in the condition code (R15), and it also sets the stack fault bit in the interrupt request register. If interrupts are enabled and the stack fault bit is set in the interrupt mask register, then an interrupt will occur after the push instruction completes. There will be no interrupt if interrupts are disabled, or the stack fault bit is not set in the mask register.</p>
<p>Push is an EXP2 format instruction comprising two words.</p>

<h3 id="pop">pop</h3>
<p>The pop instruction removes the top element from a stack and loads it into the destination register. (See push for a description of representation of a stack.)</p>
<p>pop R1,R2,R3</p>

<h2 id="comparisons">Comparisons</h2>
<p>The comparison instructions compare the values in two operand registers and produce one or more Booleans indicating the relation between the operands. The result can either loaded into a register as a word containing a Boolean (cmplt, cmpeq, cmpgt), or it can be indicated by setting a number of separate Booleans in the condition code register R15 (cmp).</p>
<h3 id="cmplt">cmplt</h3>
<p>The <strong>compare for less than</strong> instruction <em>cmplt Rd,Ra,Rb</em> performs an integer comparison of the operands. If Ra&lt;Rb then the destination Rd is set to 0001; otherwise it is set to 0000.</p>
<p>The comparison treats the operands as signed integers, not as binary numbers. For example, ffff is the two’s complement representation of -1, while 0002 is the two’s complement representation of 2, so ffff &lt; 0002.</p>
<p>The result of a comparison is a Boolean, either false or true. False is represented as 0000, and true is represented as 0001.</p>
<h3 id="cmpeq">cmpeq</h3>
<p>The <strong>compare for equality</strong> instruction <em>cmpeq Rd,Ra,Rb</em> performs an bitwise comparison of the operands. If Ra and Rb contain the same value then the destination Rd is set to 0001; otherwise it is set to 0000.</p>
<p>This instruction can be used to compare for equality of either integers (binary) numbers or integers (two’s complement).</p>
<p>The result of a comparison is a Boolean, either false or true. False is represented as 0000, and true is represented as 0001.</p>
<h3 id="cmpgt">cmpgt</h3>
<p>The <strong>compare for greater than</strong> instruction <em>cmpgt Rd,Ra,Rb</em> performs an integer comparison of the operands. If Ra&gt;Rb then the destination Rd is set to 0001; otherwise it is set to 0000.</p>
<p>The comparison treats the operands as signed integers, not as binary numbers. For example, ffff is the two’s complement representation of -1, while 0002 is the two’s complement representation of 2, so 0002 &gt; ffff.</p>
<p>The result of a comparison is a Boolean, either false or true. False is represented as 0000, and true is represented as 0001.</p>
<h3 id="cmp">cmp</h3>
<p>The <strong>compare</strong> instruction <em>cmp Ra,Rb</em> performs both an integer (two’s complement) and a natural (binary) comparison of the operands. The results are indicated in several of the flags in the condition code register, which is R15.</p>
<h2 id="transfer-of-control">Transfer of control</h2>
<h3 id="jump">jump</h3>
<p>The <strong>jump</strong> instruction <em>jump disp[Ra]</em> transfers control to the instruction in memory at the effective address <em>disp+Ra</em>.</p>
<h3 id="jumpf">jumpf</h3>
<p>The <strong>jump if false</strong> instruction <em>jumpf Rd,disp[Ra]</em> checks the Boolean value of Rd. If this is <em>false</em>, the instruction transfers control to the instruction in memory at the effective address <em>disp+Ra</em>; otherwise the instruction does nothing.</p>
<h3 id="jumpt">jumpt</h3>
<p>The <strong>jump if true</strong> instruction <em>jumpf Rd,disp[Ra]</em> checks the Boolean value of Rd. If this is <em>true</em>, the instruction transfers control to the instruction in memory at the effective address <em>disp+Ra</em>; otherwise the instruction does nothing.</p>
<h3 id="jumpc0">jumpc0</h3>
<p>The <strong>jump if condition code bit is 0</strong> instruction <em>jumpc0 k,disp[Ra]</em> checks the value of bit k in R15, which is the condition code register. If this bit is <em>0</em>, then the instruction transfers control to the instruction in memory at the effective address <em>disp+Ra</em>; otherwise the instruction does nothing.</p>
<h3 id="jumpc1">jumpc1</h3>
<p>The <strong>jump if condition code bit is 1</strong> instruction <em>jumpc1 k,disp[Ra]</em> checks the value of bit k in R15, which is the condition code register. If this bit is <em>1</em>, then the instruction transfers control to the instruction in memory at the effective address <em>disp+Ra</em>; otherwise the instruction does nothing.</p>
<h3 id="jal">jal</h3>
<p>The <strong>jump and link</strong> instruction <em>jal Rd,disp[Ra]</em> loads the address of the following instruction into the destination register Rd, and transfers control to the instruction in memory at the effective address <em>disp+Ra</em>.</p>
<p>The value loaded into Rd is the address of the instruction that immediately follows the jal. This instruction is used for calling procedures or functions: the effective address is the location of the procedure, and the return address is in Rd. The procedure can then return by jumping to the return address, e.g. with <em>jump 0[Rd]</em>.</p>

<h2 id="bit-operations">Bit operations</h2>
<p>The following instructions treat a word as a sequence of bits, and operate on the individual bits.</p>
<h3 id="inv">inv</h3>
<p>The <strong>invert</strong> instruction <em>inv Rd,Ra</em> inverts the bits in the operand Ra and places the result in the destination Rd. The operand Ra is not changed. Inverting a bit means changing 0 to 1, and changing 1 to 0.</p>
<p>Suppose R8 contains 035f. Then the following instruction will set R3 to fca0, and leave R8 unchanged.</p>
<pre><code>   inv R3,R8</code></pre>
<h3 id="and">and</h3>
<p>The <strong>logical and</strong> instruction <em>inv Rd,Ra,Rb</em> calculates the logical “and” (conjunction) of the bits in the operands Ra and Rb, and places the result in the destination Rd. The operand registers are not changed. The logical and of two bits is 1 if both bits are 1, and 0 otherwise.</p>
<h3 id="or">or</h3>
<p>The <strong>logical or</strong> instruction <em>inv Rd,Ra,Rb</em> calculates the logical “inclusive or” (disjucntion) of the bits in the operands Ra and Rb, and places the result in the destination Rd. The operand registers are not changed. The logical or of two bits is 1 if either or both of the bits are 1, and 0 otherwise.</p>
<h3 id="xor">xor</h3>
<p>The <strong>logical exclusive or</strong> instruction <em>inv Rd,Ra,Rb</em> calculates the logical “exclusive or” of the bits in the operands Ra and Rb, and places the result in the destination Rd. The operand registers are not changed. The logical exclusive or of two bits is 1 if one or the other of the bits is 1, and 0 otherwise.</p>
<p>The exclusive or of two bits is the same as the inclusive or if either bit is 0. The only time it is different is if both bits are 1: in that case exclusive or gives 0 but inclusive or gives 1.</p>
<h3 id="shiftl">shiftl</h3>
<p>The instruction shiftl Rd,Ra,k shifts the value in the operand register Ra by k bits to the left, and the result is placed in the destination register Rd. The operand Ra is not modified. During the shift, the leftmost k bits of the value are discarded and the rightmost k bits become 0.</p>
<pre><code>   shiftl  R2,R3,5</code></pre>
<p>The instruction format is EXP, and the assembly language statement format is RRKEXP</p>
<h3 id="shiftr">shiftr</h3>
<p>Shift to the right.</p>
<p>The instruction shiftr Rd,Ra,k shifts the value in the operand register Ra by k bits to the right, and the result is placed in the destination register Rd. The operand Ra is not modified. During the shift, the rightmost k bits of the value are discarded and the leftmost k bits become 0.</p>
<p>The following instruction shifts the value in R3 to the right by 5 bits and place the result in R2. The operand register R3 is not changed.</p>
<pre><code>   shiftr  R2,R3,5</code></pre>
<p>The instruction format is EXP, and the assembly language statement format is RRKEXP</p>
<h3 id="bit-fields">Bit fields</h3>
<p>A <strong>bit field</strong> denotes a string of consecutive bits taken from within a word, specified by a starting position and a field size.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The starting position is specified as a 4-bit binary number g, such that 0 &lt;= g &lt;= 15. The bits are indexed from the left starting with 0, so the leftmost (most significant) bit is bit 0, and the rightmost (least significant) is bit 15.</p></li>
<li>The field size is specified as a -bit binary number h, so 0 &lt;= h &lt;=
<ol start="15" type="1">
<li></li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<p>The notation W.{g,h} means a bit field starting at position g, of size h bits. If h is too large, the field ends at the rightmost bit of the word. W is typically a register. Thus R5.{0,4} is a 4-bit field comprising the leftmost four bits of R5.</p>
<h3 id="extract">extract</h3>
<p>The extract instruction finds an arbitrary field from a source register and loads it right-adjusted into the destination register. For example, extract R1,R2,5,4 extracts a field from R2 starting at bit position 5 (where the leftmost bit is position 0) and with a field size of 6 bits. This 6-bit result is placed in R1 in the rightmost bits; the leftmost bits are all set to 0.</p>
<pre><code> extract Rd,Re,g,h   ; Rd.{16-h,h} := Re.{g,h}
 inject  Rd,Re,g,h   ; Rd.{g,h} := Re.{16-h,h}
 field   Rd,g,h      ; gives 000011110000000 with 1s in the field</code></pre>
<p>Using a mask * can invert it to give negative mask * can and R1 with mask to keep only field * can or R1 with mask to clear only</p>
<p>Set R1.{g,h} to R1.{g,h} &amp; R2.{g,h}</p>
<p>Set R1.{g,y} to 0 ~~~~ mask R2,g,h R2 = 0000111000000 inv R2 R2 = 1111000111111 and R1,R1,R2 R1 = ….000…… ~~~~</p>
<p>Set R1.{g,y} to 1 ~~~~ mask R2,g,h R2 = 0000111000000 or R1,R1,R2 R1 = ….111…… ~~~~</p>
<p>Invert {g,h} in R1</p>
<pre><code>   mask R2,g,h     R2 = 0000111000000
   xor  R1,R1,R2   R1 =  </code></pre>
<p>and Rd,Re,g,h would be mask R5,g,h and Re,Re,R5 and</p>
<p>Format RRKKEXP. The operands are all in the second word of the instruction.</p>
<h3 id="execute">execute</h3>
<p>The <em>execute</em> instruction commands the computer to execute another instruction which is in the register file. The first word of this target instruction is in Re and the second word (in case it’s a two-word instruction) is in Rf. If Re contains an RRR instruction, then Rf is ignored.</p>
<pre><code>   execute Re,Rf</code></pre>
<p>Format RREXP. Both operands are in the second word of the instruction, in the e and f fields.</p>

<p>The <strong>return from interrupt</strong> instruction performs the following operations simultaneously and atomically:</p>
<ul>
<li>status := istat</li>
<li>pc := ipc</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important that this is an atomic operation. If either of the two register updates were performed before the other, then the second one would not function correctly. In the digital circuit implementing the processor, these two register updates are genuinely simultaneous: they happen during the same clock cycle, at exactly the same time.</p>
<p>The instruction format is EXP0. As there is no operand, every rfi instruction has the same machine language representation: e000. The fields are op, d, ab; op=14 to indicate EXP format, d=0 because it is unused, and ab=0 because this is the secondary opcode of rfi.</p>
<p>This instruction is privileged. Since the instruction changes the status register, it can be used to perform a context switch.</p>

<h1 id="assembly-language-1">Assembly Language</h1>
<p>A computer is a digital circuit that executes programs in machine language, which is hard for humans to read because it consists entirely of numbers. Assembly language provides a readable notation for writing machine language programs. It uses names for instructions and variables, as well as other notations to make the code easier to understand.</p>
<p>An instruction in machine language is just one or more words (often written in hexadecimal notation), while the corresponding instruction in assembly language uses mnemonic names so the programmer doesn’t have to memorise all the operation codes, addresses of variables, and so on. For example, the assembly language statement mul R12,R3,R8 is more readable than the corresponding machine language instruction 2c38. However, the assembly language still gives the programmer complete control over every bit a program.</p>
<p>Each line of source code is an assembly language statement. Unlike higher level languages, assembly language statements are not nested. There are three kinds of assembly language statement:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Most statements specify either an instruction or some constant data.</p></li>
<li><p>Some statements are full line comments.</p></li>
<li><p>Other statements are <em>directives</em>, which control the behavior of the assembler but don’t generate any code.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Humans write assembly language. The program is text: red}add R4,R2,R12. It’s easier to read, you don’t need to remember all the codes, and memory addresses are much easier to handle.</p>
<p>The computer executes machine language: The program is words containing 16-bit numbers: 042c. It’s possible for a digital circuit (the computer) to execute. No names for instructions or variables: everything is a number.</p>
<p>A human writes a machine-level program in assembly language. A software application called the <em>assembler</em> reads it in and translates it to machine language. When it sees an instruction mnemonic like add or div, it replaces it with the operation code (0, 3, or whatever). The assembler helps with variable names — the machine language needs addresses (numbers) and the assembler calculates them</p>
<ul>
<li>You can use names (add, div) rather than numeric codes (0, 3)</li>
<li>You can use variable names (x, y, sum) rather than memory addresses (02c3, 18d2)</li>
<li>You write a program in assemply language</li>
<li>The  translates it into machine language</li>
</ul>
<p>Compilers and assemblers are similar in some ways: both of them translate a program from one language to another. The main difference is that compilers translate between languages that are very different, while assemblers translate between very similar languages.</p>
<p>Example: a sequence of RRR instructions</p>
<p>Assembly language ~~~~ add R3,R5,R1 sub R4,R2,R3 mul R1,R9,R10<br />
~~~~</p>
<p>Machine language ~~~<sub> 0351 1423 219a </sub>~~~</p>
<h2 id="notation">Notation</h2>
<p>A name must begin with a letter (a-z or A-Z), and may contain letters, digits, or underscore characters.</p>
<p>Constants can be written in decimal, hexadecimal, or binary:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Decimal constants consist of a sequence of digits, with an optional leading - sign. Examples: 42 55039 -1</p></li>
<li><p>Hexadecimal constants are written with a dollar sign $ followed by four hex digits (0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 a b c d e f). Examples: $0249 $c78a</p></li>
<li><p>Binary constants are written with a hash sign # followed by any number of 0 or 1 characters. You can write fewer than 16 bits; they will be padded on the left with zeros. Examples: #1101 #000100000001101</p></li>
</ul>
<p>An expression denotes a 16-bit word. Usually they are used to specify a word of machine language, either an address or a data constant.</p>
<h2 id="statement-formats">Statement formats</h2>
<p>A statement may contain several fields. A field consists of non-space characters (with one exception: a space may appear in a string literal). Fields are separated from each other by one or more white space characters.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Label. The label field is optional. If present, the label must be a name and it must begin in the first character of the line. If the first character is a space, then that line has no label.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Operation. The operation field specifies an instruction or assembler directive. It must be preceded by one or more white space characters. Every statement (apart from a full line comment) must have an operation field, which must be a name.</p></li>
<li><p>Operands. The operands field specifies operands for an instruction or arguments for assembly directive. Most instructions and assembler directives require operands, but some do not.</p></li>
<li><p>Comment. All text that follows white space after the operands field is a comment, and is ignored by the assembler. If one or more of the other fields (label, operation, operands) is missing, the comment must be preceded by a semicolon to prevent it from being interpreted as operands. The rule is: all text after a semicolon is a comment, and all text after white space following operands is a comment. A statement where the first non-space character is a semicolon is a full line comment. If the statement has no operands, then all text after the operation field is a comment. It is good practice always to begin a comment with a semicolon.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<h2 id="directives">Directives</h2>
<p>A directive is an assembly language statement that doesn’t generate an instruction, but which gives further information about how to translate the program to object code.</p>
<p>Directive formats</p>
<pre><code>ASMDIR    operand:    xyz module
ASMDIRX   expression  org 234
ASMDIRNS  list of names   import m1,m2 export a,b,c</code></pre>
<pre><code>abc        Module
x          import   Mod1
y          import   Mod1
z          import   Mod2
           export   x,y,z
           org      34
           org      $02bf
           org      *+100
codeWrite  equ  2
codeRead   equ  1

astart     data 5
           data 9
           data 78
aend
asize      equ  aend-astart</code></pre>
<h3 id="data-statement">data statement</h3>
<p>The data statement specifies a sequence of constants to be placed in consecutive memory locations starting at the location counter, subject to relocation. Its argument is a list of one or more 4-digit hex constants separated by commas.</p>
<p>A long block of data can be broken up into several data statements. Suppose x1, x2, etc are 4-digit hex constants. Then</p>
<pre><code>data  x1,x2,x3,x4,x5,x6</code></pre>
<p>is equivalent to</p>
<pre><code>data x1,x2,x3
data x4,x5,x6</code></pre>
<p>Suppose</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The module’s relocation constant is r</p></li>
<li><p>The location counter has been set to c</p></li>
<li><p>The i’th constant (counting from 0) in a data statement is x.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Then the linker will set mem[r+c+i] := x.</p>
<p>One point to watch out for is that an assembly language data statement uses $ to indicate that a number is a hex constant (e.g. $03b7) but the object language data statement requires all numbers to be 4-digit hex constants, and does not require (or allow) a preceding $ character</p>
<h3 id="module-statement">module statement</h3>
<p>Declare the name of the module. The argument must be an indentifier. The following statement says that this is the object code for module named abc.</p>
<pre><code>module abc</code></pre>
<p>A program may be organized as a collection of modules, where each module appears in a separate file. When several modules are present, each one needs a unique name. The purpose of the module statement is to specify this name.</p>
<p>A small program can be written as just one module, and it may have a module name but this is not required.</p>
<p>The module statement defines the name of a module. The statement is optional. If present, it must be the first statement in the program, apart from full line comments and blank lines. A file may contain only one module statement, and if the statement “MyModuleName module” is present the file name should be MyModuleName.asm.txt.</p>
<p>Examples</p>
<p>quicksort module main module myprog module</p>
<h3 id="org-statement">org statement</h3>
<p>The org statement sets the location counter to a specified address. Currently the argument must be a a 4-digit hexadecimal constant, such as 3b9f.</p>
<pre><code>org  0a04</code></pre>
<p>The org statement specifies where in memory instructions and data should be placed when the program is booted. It takes an operand consisting of a word value, and it sets the location counter to this value.</p>
<p>Examples</p>
<p>org $0f20 ; subsequent instructions start from 0f20 org *+50 ; skip 50 words</p>
<p>The assembler initializes the location counter to 0 before it begins translating an assembly language module. This means that, in effect, every module begins with org 0.</p>
<h3 id="import-statment">import statment</h3>
<pre><code>import mod3,sqr,addr,addr,...</code></pre>
<p>The import statement states that the value of an identifier is defined in another module. During the assembly of the module containing the import, the identifier is given a provisional value of 0, but this will be replaced by the actual value by the linker. For example,</p>
<pre><code>    x          import   Mod1</code></pre>
<p>a</p>
<p>says that x is a name that can be used in this module, but it is defined in Mod1 and its actual value will remain unknown until the linker sets it later on.</p>
<h3 id="export-statement">export statement</h3>
<p>An export statement says that the module is making the value of a symbol available for use in other modules, which may import it. The statement takes two operands: the name being exported and the value, which must be a 4-digit hex constant. It makes no difference whether the name is relocatable, as the linker performs any relocation before writing the exported value into other modules that import it. Examples:</p>
<pre><code>export  haltcode,0
export  fcn,002c</code></pre>
<p>The export statement states that the value of an identifier should be made available for other modules to import. For example, this module defines a function and exports it so other modules can import and call it:</p>
<pre><code>Mod1     module
         export fcn

fcn      add    R1,R1,R1
         jump   0[R12]</code></pre>
<h3 id="equ-statement">equ statement</h3>
<pre><code>trapWrite   equ  2</code></pre>
<h2 id="assembly-listing">Assembly listing</h2>
<p>The first section of the assembly listing shows each line of the source program. The line number appears first, followed by the memory address that the instruction on this line will be placed in. The address is given as a 4 digit hexadecimal number, and it is binary (not two’s complement). Next comes the machine language code generated by the line of source code. If the line contains a two-word instruction, there will be two 4-digit hexadecimal values; for a one-word instruction there will be one hex number, and if the line doesn’t produce any code these fields will be blank. After the code, the original source statement appears.</p>
<p>The second section of the assembly listing is the <em>Symbol Table</em>. This shows each identifier (or “symbol”) that appears in the program, the address allocated for the symbol, the source code line where it was defined, and the source code lines where it was used.</p>
<h1 id="linker">Linker</h1>
<p>The assembler doesn’t translate a source module in assembly langauge directly to raw machine language. Instead, it produces an <em>object module</em> which contains some additional metadata along with the machine language code. This metadata enables the linker to combine the object module with other modules into an <em>executable module</em>.</p>
<h2 id="programs-modules-and-files">Programs, modules, and files</h2>
<p>The system is designed to allow programs that consist of several modules, but also to allow programs consisting of one standalone module. In addition, an aim is to do this simply and intuitively, so that you can ignore the issues of modules and linking if you just want to write a andalone program.</p>
<p>There is a standard convention for file names. If, for example, you have a program named MyProgram, then the files associated with it should be as follows:</p>
<hr />
<p>module name MyProgram source file MyProgram.asm.txt object file MyProgram.obj.txt assembly listing MyProgram.lst.txt —————– ———–</p>
<h2 id="simple-standalone-programs">Simple standalone programs</h2>
<p>If a program does not import any names, it is <em>standalone</em>. The text of the program is shown in the editor pane. Go to the Assembler pane and click Assemble. If there are no errors, go directly to the Processor pane (you can skip the Linker) and click Boot. This will read the machine language into the memory, and now you can run the program.</p>
<h2 id="programs-with-multiple-modules">Programs with multiple modules</h2>
<p>A module consists of program text, and it may have an optional file, and an optional module name.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The module text is a sequence of assembly language statements. The text may exist only in the editor buffer, or it may be associated with a file.</p>
<ul>
<li>If there is a file, this may be specified either as a path (the unique identification of the file (C:\Users....asm.txt), or as just a filename (myprogram.asm.txt) which is relative to the current directory.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>To edit a file, the modDir and modName are both optional. An edited file may have a module name specified with a module statement. To read or save a file, both the module directory and name must be known.</p>
<p>Editor operations on files and modules</p>
<p>Each operation that changes the editor buffer (New, Open, Close) checks first to see whehter the buffer has been changed since it was last saved. If so, a dialogue asks whether the file should be saved.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>New – Check whether text in the editor buffer has been saved; if not, ask whether to save it. Create a new module with empty text and no file name, add it to the module set, and select it as the current module. Clear the text in the editor buffer.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Open – Check whether text in the editor buffer has been saved; if not, ask whether to save it. Enter the open file dialogue where an existing file can be found by navigation or by typing in its name. If the dialogue is cancelled, the module set and editor buffer are left unchanged. If a file is selected in the dialogue, and it is already in the module set, then it is selected in the current module. Otherwise, a new module is created with the file’s contents, and is selected as the current module. and The file is loaded into the editor buffer and added to the module set.</p></li>
<li><p>Refresh – The file corresponding to the current module is read, and its contents are loaded into the editor buffer.</p></li>
<li><p>SaveAs – Enters the save file dialogue where the directory and file name can be chosen. The editor buffer is written into this file.</p></li>
<li><p>Save – Writes the editor buffer into the current file and directory. If either the module name or directory is not known, this reverts to a SaveAs.</p></li>
<li><p>Select – Opens a list of all modules; you can click one of them which is then set as the current module.</p></li>
<li><p>Close – Check whether text in the editor buffer has been saved; if not, ask whether to save it. The module is removed from the module set, and the editor buffer is cleared. The first module (module number 0) is selected as the current module, but if there is no module at all, an empty module is created and selected as current (in effect, if there is only one module and you close it, an automatic New is performed).</p></li>
<li><p>Example – Reads in a very simple example program and sets it as the current module. This is a standalone program; you can simply click Editor: Example, then Assembler: Assemble, then Processor: Boot, and run the program. This example is used in the first “getting started” tutorial. The example program is also available in the Examples directory, accessible through Editor: Open.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Select is for switching among the existing modules, while New and Open are for introducing a new module.</p>
<h2 id="object-code">Object code</h2>
<p>Ojbect modules are specified in an object code language with a simple syntax and only a few types of statement. Each object statement is written on line line. It begins with a keyword indicating the type of statement, followed by white space, followed by an operand which must not contain any spaces. Operands may contain either hex constants or identifiers.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In the object language, hex constants are written as four characters, using digits 0-9 a-f. Unlike assembly language, a hex constant is not preceded by $.</p></li>
<li><p>Identifiers have the same syntax as in assembly language: a string of letters, digits, and underscore characters, beginning with a letter.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The object language has six statements: module, org, data, import, export, and relocate. These are related to corresponding statements in assembly language, but their syntax is different. For example, an import statement in assembly language will generate one or more import statements in the object code, but those statements have a different syntax and contain different information.</p>
<h3 id="relocate-statement">relocate statement</h3>
<p>The relocate statement specifies a list of addresses of words that must be relocated. Suppose the value x is specified in a relocate statement, and the linker is relocating the module by offset y. Then the linker will set mem[x+y] = obj[x]+y.</p>
<pre><code>relocate hex4,hex4,...</code></pre>
<h2 id="executable-code">Executable code</h2>
<p>An executable module is written in the same language as object modules. The only difference is that an executable module must contain only these types of statement: module, data, org. It is now allowed to contain any of the following statments: import, export, relocate.</p>
<p>If an assembly language program doesn’t contain any import or export directives, then its object code won’t contain any import, export, or relcate statements. In this case, the object code is already executable and does not require linking: it can be booted directly by the processor.</p>
<p>The booter (invoked by clicking the Boot button in the processor page) reads in the currently selected module and checks to see whether it is a valid executable module. If so, it loads the code into the memory. If not, it indicates that the program cannot be booted.</p>
<h1 id="programming">Programming</h1>
<p>(This section under development)</p>
<h2 id="structure-of-a-program">Structure of a program</h2>
<p>Simple (“static”) variabls need to be declared with a data statement, which also gives an initial value.</p>
<pre><code>x  data  23</code></pre>
<p>This means: allocate a word in memory for x and initialize it to 23. The data statements should come after the trap instruction that terminates the program</p>
<h2 id="how-to-perform-commmon-tasks">How to perform commmon tasks</h2>
<h3 id="copying-one-register-to-another">Copying one register to another</h3>
<p>Sometimes you want to copy a value from one register to another: R3 := R12. There isn’t an instruction specifically for this purpose, because there is no need: just use the add instruction:</p>
<pre><code>add R3,R12,R0 ; R3 := R12</code></pre>
<p>Since R12 + 0 = R12, this copies the value in R12 into R3. One might think that this is less efficient than having a special instruction to perform the copy, but it actually turns out to be more efficient to do it this way!</p>
<h2 id="compilation">Compilation</h2>
<p>There are two ways to handle variables:</p>
<p>The statement-by-statement style: Each statement is compiled independently. The pattern is: load, arithmetic, store. Straightforward but inefficient.</p>
<p>The register-variable style: Keep variables in registers across a group of statements. Don’t need as many loads and stores. More efficient. You have to keep track of whether variables are in memory or a register. Use comments to show register usage. Real compilers use this style. Use this style if you like the shorter code it produces.</p>
<p>We’ll translate the following program fragment to assembly language, using each style:</p>
<pre><code>x = 50;
y = 2*z;
x = x+1+z;</code></pre>
<p>Statement-by-statement style</p>
<pre><code>; x = 50;
     lea    R1,$0032   ; R1 = 50
     store  R1,x[R0]   ; x = 50

; y = 2*z;
     lea    R1,$0002   ; R1 = 2
     load   R2,z[R0]   ; R2 = z
     mul    R3,R1,R2   ; R3 = 2*z
     store  R3,y[R0]   ; y = 2*z

; x = x+1+z;
     load   R1,x[R0]   ; R1 = x
     lea    R2,1[R0]   ; R2 = 1
     load   R3,z[R0]   ; R3 = z
     add    R4,R1,R2   ; R4 = x+1
     add    R4,R4,R3   ; R4 = x+1+z
     store  R4,x[R0]   ; x = x+1+z</code></pre>
<p>Register-variable style</p>
<pre><code>; Usage of registers
;   R1 = x
;   R2 = y
;   R3 = z

; x = 50;
     lea    R1,$0032   ; x = 50
     load   R3,z[R0]   ; R3 = z
     lea    R4,$0002   ; R4 = 2
; y = 2*z;
     mul    R2,R4,R3   ; y = 2*z
; x = x+1+z;
     lea    R4,$0001   ; R4 = 1
     add    R1,R1,R4   ; x = x+1
     add    R1,R1,R3   ; x = x+z
     store  R1,x[R0]   ; move x to memory
     store  R2,y[R0]   ; move y to memory</code></pre>
<p>Comparison of the styles</p>
<p>Statement by statement. * Each statement is compiled into a separate block of code. * Each statement requires loads, computation, then stores. * A variable may appear in several different registers. * There may be a lot of redundant loading and storing. * The object code corresponds straightforwardly to the source code, but it may be unnecessarily long.</p>
<p>Register variable * The instructions corresponding to the statemnts are mixed together. * Some statements are executed entirely in the registers. * A variable is kept in the same register across many statments. * The use of loads and stores is minimised. * The object code is concise, but it’s harder to see how it corresponds to the source code. * It’s possible to have a mixture of the styles: you don’t have to follow one or the other all the time.</p>
<h1 id="circuit">Circuit</h1>
<p>There is a complete digital circuit called M1 that implements the core of the Sigma16 architecture (apart from the divide instruction). This circuit is specified completely down to the level of logic gates and flip flops. M1 uses sequential control and does not have instruction level parallelism. Its design is written in Hydra, a functional computer hardware description language. The circuit can be simulated, and you can run Sigma16 programs on the circuit.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to run the Sigma16 circuit on the simulator:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Download Hydra and save it in your workspace. Suppose its location is /c/Users/me/a/b/c/Hydra.</p></li>
<li><p>Open a shell and enter circuit/M1. Run a test program, e.g. ArrayMax.hs, with the following command, which will execute the ArrayMax program on the digital circuit. The simulation will produce detailed simulation output showing the values in key registers, flip flops, and signals during every clock cycle.</p></li>
</ul>
<pre><code>ghci -i/c/Users/me/a/b/c/Hydra/src/haskell/ ArrayMaxRun</code></pre>
<p>The command can be simplified by defining a .ghci file, which will be loaded automatically when you invoke ghci. You can put the .ghci file in your $HOME directory. See the GHC User Guide for more details about configuring ghci. The .ghci file could contain a definition similar to this:</p>
<pre><code>:set -i/c/Users/a/b/c/Hydra/src/haskell/</code></pre>
<h1 id="installation">Installation</h1>
<p>The application currently works with Chrome and Firefox, and possible Edge.</p>
<p>The software is available on the Internet at the <a href="https://jtod.github.io/home/Sigma16/">Sigma16 home page</a>, which contains a link to the latest version, some previous versions, related documents, and more information about the project.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-run-sigma16">How to run Sigma16</h2>
<p>There are a number of ways to run the software, but it’s recommended that you try the easiest way.</p>
<h3 id="the-easiest-way-just-click-a-link">The easiest way: just click a link</h3>
<p>Run the app with two clicks:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Visit the <a href="https://jtod.github.io/home/Sigma16/">Sigma16 homepage</a></li>
<li>Click on <em>Launch the latest release</em></li>
</ol>
<p>This will run the app in your browser, and you don’t need to download or install anything. For most users this is the recommended method.</p>
<h3 id="download-and-open-file-in-browser">Download and open file in browser</h3>
<p>If you don’t always have Internet access, you can download the files and ope the app in your browser. This is easy to do and allows you to run Sigma16 even when you don’t have access to the Internet. However, it is a little more awkward to run the example programs.</p>
<p>You can also download the software onto your computer and run it locally. This exactly like the first method, except the web pages are coming from your computer’s files rather than the Internet.</p>
<p>Visit the <a href="https://jtod.github.io/Sigma16/index.html">Sigma16 home page</a> and download the zip file for the latest release. Unzip and click on index.html in the folder and follow the directions.</p>
<p>You might also be able to launch it by <a href="../../Sigma16.html">clicking this link</a> although that might not work; it depends on whether all the necessary files are accessible.</p>
<h3 id="run-locally-with-npm-and-electron">Run locally with npm and electron</h3>
<p>The previous methods run the app in a browser. There are some security restrictions on what a browser can do, and these make it slightly awkward for the program to read and write files. You can perform a local installation which will run Sigma16 as a standalone app on your computer, rather than in a browser, and this makes it a little more convenient to use.</p>
<p>If you don’t want to bother with downloading some software tools and running an installation script, you can skip to the next method, which is to download a precompiled executable for your platform. But it’s straightforward to build Sigma16 on your computer:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You need a shell such as bash or Windows PowerShell. Every computer will have one.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Install the npm package manager for JavaScript, available at <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm">https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm</a>. Download the installer and follow the instructions.</p></li>
<li><p>Install the <em>electron</em> package. In your shell, enter <em>npm install electron –save-dev</em>. (Why is it called “electron”? Originally, there was a text editor named <em>Atom</em> written in JavaScript, and it needed a shell. So it’s the electron shell for atom…</p></li>
<li><p>Download the source for Sigma16. Unzip it, and cd into the app directory. Enter <em>make all</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>To launch Sigma16, enter <em>npm run start</em>. Now you’ll have enhanced file access, as well as a few other minor enhancements, and you don’t need Internet access.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="compiling-a-standalone-executable">Compiling a standalone executable</h3>
<p>First install npm, which also gives you Node.js. Use npm to install electron.</p>
<p>cd src npm install npm start</p>
<p>Clone this repository, then enter the repository, install dependencies, and run the program:</p>
<p>git clone https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start cd electron-quick-start npm install npm start</p>
<p>To build standalone version using Node.hs and electron. In the src/app directory, use the following commands. They create a file package-lock.json and a directory node_modules, both in src/app.</p>
<p>npm install npm start</p>
<p>The pkg program can generate a native executable which doesn’t require the user to have npm installed.</p>
<p>npm install -g pkg pkg –help pkg main.js</p>
<p>Maybe the bin entry in package.json would allow the command to be just pkg . ? In src directory tried this:</p>
<p>$ pkg -t win-x64 app</p>
<p>Lots of warnings:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Warning Cannot include directory %1 into executable. The directory must be distributed with executable as %2. app_modules path-to-executable/electron/dist</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Warning Cannot include file %1 into executable. The file must be distributed with executable as %2. app_modules.js path-to-executable/node_modules/sliced/index.js</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Warning Cannot include file %1 into executable. The file must be distributed with executable as %2. app_modules-defaults.js path-to-executable/node_modules/deep-defaults/index.js</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Turns out that to build an app with electron one of the following specific tools is needed:</p>
<p>electron-forge electron-builder electron-packager</p>
<p>Trying electron-builder</p>
<p>npm install electron-builder –save-dev in src/app npm run mkdist</p>
<p><strong>Version number</strong></p>
<p>The version number is needed in several places. To keep it consistent, there is only one primary place where it should be specified manually: in the version property in app/package.json.</p>
<p>The makefile extracts the version number from that file, and (1) defines a make variable; (2) writes the Sigma16/VERSION file with just the version number, and (3) writes Sigma16/app/version.js which is just defines the version number as a global constant.</p>
<h1 id="about-sigma16">About Sigma16</h1>
<p>This program is experimental software, and is under development. Sigma16 consists of several components:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is written in JavaScript, and normally uses a web browser to display the graphical user interface. The assembler, linker, and emulator are also implemented in JavaScript and are closely integrated with the IDE.</p></li>
<li><p>The circuits that implement Sigma16 are defined using the Hydra hardware description language, which is an embedded domain specific language implemented in Haskell.</p></li>
<li><p>The User Guide is written in markdown and prepared for a web browser using pandoc.</p></li>

<p>GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3, 29 June 2007</p>
<p>Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <a href="https://fsf.org/" class="uri">https://fsf.org/</a></p>
<p>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>
<p>Preamble The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.</p>
<p>The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program–to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.</p>
<p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.</p>
<p>To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.</p>
<p>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.</p>
<p>Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.</p>
<p>For the developers’ and authors’ protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users’ and authors’ sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.</p>
<p>Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users’ freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.</p>
<p>Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.</p>
<p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.</p>
<p>TERMS AND CONDITIONS 0. Definitions. “This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.</p>
<p>“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.</p>
<p>“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and “recipients” may be individuals or organizations.</p>
<p>To “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.</p>
<p>A “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.</p>
<p>To “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.</p>
<p>To “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.</p>
<p>An interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Source Code. The “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. “Object code” means any non-source form of a work.</li>
</ol>
<p>A “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.</p>
<p>The “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A “Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.</p>
<p>The “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work’s System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.</p>
<p>The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.</p>
<p>The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Basic Permissions. All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.</li>
</ol>
<p>You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.</p>
<p>Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Protecting Users’ Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law. No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.</li>
</ol>
<p>When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work’s users, your or third parties’ legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Conveying Verbatim Copies. You may convey verbatim copies of the Program’s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.</li>
</ol>
<p>You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Conveying Modified Source Versions. You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</li>
</ol>
<ol type="a">
<li>The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.</li>
<li>The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to “keep intact all notices”.</li>
<li>You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.</li>
<li>If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so. A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>Conveying Non-Source Forms. You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:</li>
</ol>
<ol type="a">
<li>Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.</li>
<li>Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.</li>
<li>Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.</li>
<li>Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.</li>
<li>Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d. A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.</li>
</ol>
<p>A “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, “normally used” refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.</p>
<p>“Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.</p>
<p>If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).</p>
<p>The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.</p>
<p>Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>Additional Terms. “Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.</li>
</ol>
<p>When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or</li>
<li>Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or</li>
<li>Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or</li>
<li>Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or</li>
<li>Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or</li>
<li>Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors. All other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further restrictions” within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.</p>
<p>Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.</p>
<ol start="8" type="1">
<li>Termination. You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).</li>
</ol>
<p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.</p>
<p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.</p>
<p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.</p>
<ol start="9" type="1">
<li><p>Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies. You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.</p></li>
<li><p>Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients. Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>An “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party’s predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.</p>
<p>You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.</p>
<ol start="11" type="1">
<li>Patents. A “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor’s “contributor version”.</li>
</ol>
<p>A contributor’s “essential patent claims” are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, “control” includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.</p>
<p>Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor’s essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.</p>
<p>In the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To “grant” such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.</p>
<p>If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. “Knowingly relying” means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient’s use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.</p>
<p>If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.</p>
<p>A patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.</p>
<p>Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.</p>
<ol start="12" type="1">
<li><p>No Surrender of Others’ Freedom. If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.</p></li>
<li><p>Use with the GNU Affero General Public License. Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.</p></li>
<li><p>Revised Versions of this License. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.</p>
<p>If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.</p>
<p>Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.</p>

<li><p>Disclaimer of Warranty. THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</p></li>
<li><p>Limitation of Liability. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p></li>
<li><p>Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16. If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.</p></li>

<p>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p>
<p>How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.</p>
<p>To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the “copyright” line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</p>
<p>&lt;one line to give the program’s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt; Copyright (C) <year> <name of author></p>
<p>This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.</p>
<p>This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.</p>
<p>You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program. If not, see <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/" class="uri">https://www.gnu.org/licenses/</a>. Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.</p>
<p>If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:</p>
<p><program> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author> This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type <code>show w'.     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it     under certain conditions; type</code>show c’ for details. The hypothetical commands <code>show w' and</code>show c’ should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program’s commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an “about box”.</p>
<p>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a “copyright disclaimer” for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/" class="uri">https://www.gnu.org/licenses/</a>.</p>
<p>The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License. But first, please read <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html" class="uri">https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html</a>.</p>
