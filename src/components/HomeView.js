              Currently, this emulator and IDE runs <strong>fully functional</strong> on <strong>Google Chrome</strong> and <strong>Safari</strong>. Minor features - limited to double-clicking to resize outputs - are unavailable on <strong>Firefox</strong> and <strong>Edge</strong>, however the core of the website - breakpoints, emulation, editing and running - are unaffected and the website will still look and operate correctly

              When using the emulator, <strong>do not</strong> navigate the pages with the browser's built-in forward and backwards buttons as <strong>code will not save.</strong> Navigate using <strong>only</strong> the nav bar at the top of the screen
