<h1 id="sigma16-source-directory">Sigma16 source directory</h1>
<p>Sigma16 is a computer architecture designed for research and teaching in computer systems. This application provides a complete environment for experimenting with the architecture.</p>
<h2 id="internet-links">Internet links</h2>
<p>This page is the README for the Sigma16 source directory. To run the software, visit the <a href="https://jtod.github.io/home/Sigma16/">Sigma16 Home Page</a>, which also contains links to documentation and past releases. The URL for the Sigma16 Home page is https://jtod.github.io/home/Sigma16/ and the URL for the source repository is https://github.com/jtod/Sigma16</p>
<h2 id="links-to-local-files">Links to local files</h2>
<p>If you copy the Sigma16 source directory onto your computer, the following links will run it locally without requiring further access to the Internet. However, these links will not work if you’re reading this page on the source repository on GitHub via the Internet.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="./app/Sigma16.html">Launch from files in this directory</a> If you have copied this directory onto a local machine, this link will run it, with some limitations on file access (the User Guide won’t be visible, and you have to copy examples to the editor manually). See the Installation section in the User Guide for further ways to run the software.</li>
<li><a href="./">Up to the top directory</a> Show the listing of files in the directory containing this version.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="download">Download</h2>
<p>It isn’t necessary to download, compile, and install the software: you can just run it in a browser by clicking the Quick Start link in the Sigma16 Home Page.</p>
<p>If you want to run the app when Internet is inaccessible, you can download the software and run it locally on your machine. You don’t need any special installation; simply store the Sigma16 folder anywhere on your computer. Then there are several options:</p>
<h3 id="run-in-a-browser">Run in a browser</h3>
<p>Open the file <em>index.html</em> in a browser; this contains a link to launch the app, and there may be contain release notes. Note that a few features won’t work, because browsers restrict some operations when a web page executes from a local file (as opposed to an https server). In particular, when you open an example program (in the Examples tab), the button “Copy example to editor” won’t work. But you can select the text of the example with your mouse, right-click and Copy, then Paste it into the editor.</p>
<h3 id="run-with-npm">Run with npm</h3>
<p>See app/makefile for notes on how to run the software as a standalone program, without using a browser. The following software needs to be installed in order to build the executable using electron</p>
<pre><code>node.js
npm</code></pre>
<h3 id="compile-using-npm">Compile using npm</h3>
<pre><code>Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start
cd electron-quick-start  # Go into the repository
npm install   # Install dependencies
npm start     # Run the app</code></pre>
<p>The following files are required for compilation with npm, but they are not needed just to run the source program in a browser.</p>
<pre><code>src/main.js
src/package.json
src/package-lock.json
src/preload.js
src/renderer.hs
src/node_modules/</code></pre>
<h2 id="about-the-software">About the software</h2>
<p>The Sigma16 app (the integrated development environment – i.e. the GUI) is implemented in JavaScript, html 5, and css. The digital circuit is implemented in Hydra, which requires Haskell. Additional software tools, including a high speed emulator, are in progress and expected to be available in late 2020.</p>
<h3 id="author">Author</h3>
